Electricity prices in the coming week are forecasted to remain consistently low each day. Average prices throughout the week will remain clearly below five cents per kilowatt-hour. Negative prices will also likely occur, especially during nighttime and early morning hours.

The week's lowest prices will occur on **Sunday**, when the average price turns negative at -0.4 cents. Sunday afternoon will see hourly prices dropping multiple times to as low as -1.3 cents between 11:00 and 16:00. Positive prices, however, will still occur earlier that day until around 5:00 am.

On **Tuesday** and **Thursday**, the maximum expected price will rise to the week's highest level at 5.9 cents. On Tuesday, the most expensive period will fall in the morning between 7:00 and 9:00, while on Thursday, the peak price will occur at around 9:00 am. Wednesdayâ€™s price level will be slightly lower, but prices will still approach similarly high peaks, reaching about 4.9 cents around 9:00 pm.

Toward the end of the week, electricity will remain inexpensive. On **Friday** and **Saturday**, average prices will hover slightly above one cent, and the week's highest price peaks will already drop to lower levels. Negative hourly prices will continue to occur on both days, particularly during early morning hours.

The risk of price spikes at individual hours applies to each upcoming day. Although prices will generally stay low, consumers should be prepared for individual hourly prices that may temporarily deviate upward from the forecasts.
