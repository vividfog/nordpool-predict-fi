The upcoming week starts on **Thursday** with a favorable average price predicted to be 2.2 cents per kilowatt-hour. There is an abundance of wind power available, which partly explains the low price level. **Friday** sees the price rise to an average of 6.8 cents, with potential price spikes during certain hours. **Saturday** maintains an average price of 5.7 cents, but sporadic price spikes may occur as wind power production remains lower.

**Sunday** is when price spikes are most likely, with the average price rising to 5.9 cents and wind power production staying low throughout the day. **Monday** sees the price increasing to 10 cents, and wind power remains relatively low, which may lead to price spikes during morning and evening hours.

**Tuesday** and **Wednesday** experience more moderate prices, at 5.5 and 6.0 cents. However, on Wednesday, anticipated price spikes could raise the maximum prices for individual hours as wind power production dips during the day.
