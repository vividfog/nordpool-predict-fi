Price expectations for the week will vary clearly. The lowest averages are anticipated on Thursday (avg 3.2 ¢) and Sunday (3.3 ¢), while Tuesday’s average rises the highest (10.1 ¢). The highest single-hour prices, up to 19.0 ¢, are expected on Tuesday; on the same day a very low wind-power minimum (1435 MW) partly explains the higher peak. On Saturday the maximum is expected at 18.3 ¢, and an extremely low wind minimum (254 MW) supports the higher price. On Friday (15.3 ¢) and Monday (15.4 ¢) there will also be hours above 15 ¢. The low averages on Wednesday and Thursday are in turn linked to strong winds. In addition, Sunday is a public holiday, which typically lowers demand and keeps prices low.

The risk of price spikes will be high for individual hours on Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday and Tuesday. Timings cluster around typical demand peaks: on Friday around 08:00–10:00 and 17:00–19:00, on Saturday 08:00–10:00 and 17:00–19:00, on Sunday 10:00–12:00, on Monday 17:00–19:00, and on Tuesday 08:00–10:00 and 17:00–19:00. The cheapest hours of the week will fall during Thursday night, roughly 01:00–03:00, when the level dips below one cent.
