The weekâ€™s price path will look split: elevated hourly prices and clear intraday differences early in the week, and broadly low levels from Thursday onward. In the overall picture, the more expensive periods will fall early in the week, while later on prices will mostly drop below five cents. The weekâ€™s highest average price will be 16,4 Â¢ and the lowest 1,5 Â¢.

**Tuesday** will carry a high risk of price spikes. The dayâ€™s peak is forecast at 28,7 Â¢, with spikes most likely around 09â€“11 and 18â€“20. Intraday variation will be large: the cheapest hours will be around 6â€“7 cents before dawn. A very low minimum wind output (483 MW) will coincide with the highest hourly prices, which explains the unusually high maximum.

**Wednesday** will retain spike risk on individual hours. The highest hour is projected for the morning, roughly 08â€“10, reaching 22,4 Â¢. Later in the day, prices will drop clearly, and late evening hours will fall to as low as 1,5 Â¢ around 22â€“24. Intraday variation will therefore be considerable.

**Thursday** will settle very low: a 0,2 Â¢ minimum and 2,8 Â¢ maximum, with a 1,5 Â¢ average. Strong wind output (avg. 4420 MW) will push prices down. **Friday**, **Saturday** and **Sunday** will remain moderate, with averages at 4,8 Â¢, 5,8 Â¢ and 3,4 Â¢. The weekâ€™s cheapest hours will occur early Thursday night, around 01â€“03, when prices will be 0,2â€“0,4 Â¢. Next **Monday** will stay low (avg. 4,6 Â¢), though single hours will approach nine cents.
