At the start of the week, average prices will largely remain well above 10 cents, and the week will include a very expensive spell. The clearest outlier will be **Tuesday**, when the average price will settle at 22.7 cents and the day’s maximum is forecast at 45.9 cents. Based on the hourly outlook, the price peak will fall in the afternoon, around 15:00–17:00. **Wednesday** will also keep the average price high (21.6 ¢), even though the day’s maximum will remain clearly lower than Tuesday’s.

Prices will be pushed up on several days by severe cold, as daily average temperatures will stay below -10°C across the board. In addition, wind power will be very weak on **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, with the daily average around 1000–1300 MW and minimums dropping below 1000 MW. The risk of price spikes will be high on **Saturday**, **Monday**, **Tuesday**, **Wednesday**, **Thursday**, and **Friday** in individual hours.
