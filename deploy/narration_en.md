Price levels over the week will vary clearly. The cheapest day would be the public holiday, i.e. **Sunday**, with the average price around 3,2 cents and many hours staying below four cents. The highest average prices would fall on **Saturday**, **Monday** and **Tuesday** (9,6–10,5 ¢). The clearest single-day peak would appear on **Tuesday**, with a forecast maximum of 20,1 ¢, concentrated in the morning around 08:00–10:00. Midweek will remain moderate; in particular, **Wednesday’s** stronger winds would support the lower level.

The risk of price spikes would stand out on several days. On **Saturday**, a spike is forecast for the afternoon, around 16:00–18:00, and an exceptionally low minimum wind output (just 284 MW) would explain the higher peak. On **Monday**, the elevated maximum (18,3 ¢) would fall in the evening, around 17:00–19:00; the wind minimum would stay below 2000 MW, pushing the peak higher. On **Tuesday**, a low wind minimum (1027 MW) and the morning demand surge would lift the day’s top price around 08:00–10:00. **Sunday** would also carry a heightened spike risk, most likely around midday, 10:00–12:00, even though the day would otherwise remain clearly cheaper.
