On these days, nights and early mornings will often price below two cents; early Friday morning will dip to about 0,4 ¢ and Saturday to 0,5 ¢. Wednesday will also stay clearly under five cents, around 5,7 ¢, even though the day’s high will touch 9,7 ¢.

The clearest outlier will be **Tuesday**: the daily average will be 7,6 ¢ and the high 10,9 ¢, likely around 16:00–18:00. On **Monday**, prices are expected to stay near four cents. **Sunday** will land around 3,1 ¢. Overall, the early‑week holidays and windy conditions will keep long stretches below four cents, and the week’s highest moments will cluster on Tuesday afternoon.
