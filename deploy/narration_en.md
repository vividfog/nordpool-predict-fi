Price development during the week would skew toward higher levels early in the week and cheaper levels over the weekend. In particular, weak wind would lift prices midweek: already on **Tuesday** the level would be elevated (avg 10,7 ¢), and the spike risk for individual hours would concentrate in the evening, around 18:00–20:00. On **Wednesday**, the price outlook would be the week’s highest on the average level (avg 13,2 ¢) with a maximum reaching 22,4 ¢; the spike hours would fall around 08:00–10:00 and 16:00–18:00. **Thursday’s** peak of 22,8 ¢ would be explained by an exceptionally low minimum for wind power (679 MW), and the spike risk would target about 16:00–18:00.

Toward the end of the week the level would ease. On **Friday** the spike risk would fall in the evening (around 17:00–19:00), but the average price would already dip below 10 ¢. On **Saturday** it is a public holiday, which could lighten demand and support an average under five cents; any spikes would be minor and centered around 17:00–19:00. On **Sunday** prices would remain low throughout (avg 3,0 ¢), with a slight spike risk in the early evening around 17:00–19:00. Next **Monday** prices would drop exceptionally low (avg 0,2 ¢; range 0,1–0,4 ¢).
