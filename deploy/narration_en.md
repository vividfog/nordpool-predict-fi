In the upcoming week, electricity price developments show some variability, but overall prices remain reasonable. **Wednesday** stands out as the cheapest day of the week, with an average price of only 0.7 cents, and wind power production is at its strongest, partly explaining the low price. **Saturday** and **Sunday** are expected to have slightly higher prices, yet they remain reasonable.

The most expensive moments of the week occur on **Monday** and **Friday** evenings, with expected maximum prices of 5.8 cents. This may be due to lower wind power production on these days. **Monday** sees the lowest wind power production, contributing to the higher price.

During the week, price spikes may occur especially on **Sunday** and **Monday** evenings, when electricity demand may be higher. **Tuesday** expects moderate price forecasts again, with even negative prices possible during the night.

Overall, the week offers variable but mostly moderate price expectations, with fluctuations in wind power and occasional higher prices creating interesting situations.
