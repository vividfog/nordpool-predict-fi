Price expectations will split clearly over the week. The weekend will remain on the cheaper side, whereas the early week (Mon–Wed) will turn expensive. The highest average price will land on **Wednesday** at 14.6 ¢, and **Tuesday’s** average will be 13.7 ¢. Daily highs will exceed 20 ¢ on both Tuesday and Wednesday. The cheapest day will be **Friday**, with prices between 1.1–4.4 ¢ and an average of 2.4 ¢. **Saturday** will also stay below five cents on average (3.7 ¢). Low wind output on Tuesday and Wednesday (avg 1083–1695 MW) will help sustain the high price level.

The risk of single-hour spikes will stand out. **On Sunday**, a possible peak would fall between 18:00–20:00 (max 8.6 ¢). **On Monday**, the top hour would be 08:00–10:00 (14.7 ¢). **On Tuesday**, spikes would cluster at 17:00–19:00 (21.1 ¢), and **on Wednesday** at 08:00–10:00 (22.2 ¢). Actual peaks on Tuesday and Wednesday could materialize higher than forecast, because minimum wind output drops below 1000 MW. Wednesday’s high maximum (22.2 ¢) is explained in particular by a very low wind minimum of 952 MW. On Thursday the price level will soften without a separate spike risk, and Friday will be the week’s clearly calmest price day.
