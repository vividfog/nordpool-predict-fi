In the coming week, electricity price expectations will vary somewhat between days. **Monday** is expected to see the highest maximum price of the week, which could rise to as high as 19.3 cents. This is due to low minimum wind power production, which will be around 1034 megawatts. On **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, prices are expected to be more moderate, but price spikes could occur during certain hours, especially in the morning and evening. On Wednesday, wind power production may vary significantly during the day, which could impact prices.

In the middle of the week, on **Thursday**, the average price is expected to rise slightly but remain at a reasonable level. Wind power production will also be higher than average on this day, which can stabilize price expectations. **Friday** is expected to have the lowest prices of the week, and wind power production will be close to normal levels. This day stands out as the most economical time of the week without significant price spikes.

During the weekend, particularly on **Saturday** and **Sunday**, price expectations remain low. However, there is a risk of price spikes on Saturday, while prices on Sunday are expected to remain more stable, with relatively high wind power production. This can drive down electricity prices at the end of the week.
