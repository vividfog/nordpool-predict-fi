**Thursday** and **Friday**'s electricity price forecasts indicate higher averages, at approximately 7.4 ¢/kWh and 7.6 ¢/kWh. These days have a high risk of price spikes, particularly during morning and evening hours when wind power production is at its lowest. **Saturday** offers significantly cheaper pricing with an average price of 3.6 ¢/kWh. However, there is still a risk of individual price spikes on Saturday.

**Sunday** is expected to be the cheapest day of the week, with an average price of only 1.3 ¢/kWh, and wind power production is abundantly available. Consequently, there is no risk of price spikes on Sunday. **Monday** and **Tuesday** maintain moderate average prices at around 3.7 ¢/kWh, but the risk of price spikes remains, especially in the mornings and evenings.

**Wednesday** is predicted to have the highest average price of the week, 7.7 ¢/kWh. The minimum level of wind power production is very low, which may explain the higher maximum price, potentially reaching up to 15.9 ¢/kWh. This makes Wednesday the most expensive day of the week.
