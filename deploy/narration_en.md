The week is expected to be uneven. The cheapest day of the week is expected to be Sunday, with an average price of 4,5 ¢ and nighttime dipping to below one cent. The start of the week will be more expensive: Monday’s, Tuesday’s and Wednesday’s average prices will settle between 11–15 cents. Next Tuesday stands out clearly: the maximum is forecast at 24,2 ¢, and behind it is an exceptionally low wind-power minimum (247 MW), which explains the high peak. From Thursday to Saturday prices even out to a 9–13 cent range.

The risk of price spikes will be accentuated on the weekdays at the start and end of the week. On Monday the peaks will concentrate in the 08:00–10:00 and 18:00–20:00 windows. Next Tuesday the highest spike is forecast for the evening around 18:00–20:00. On Wednesday the morning hours 08:00–10:00 will lift the level. On Thursday a possible peak would fall around 16:00–18:00. On Friday peaks are set for the evening 18:00–20:00. On Saturday the highest hourly price is expected around 17:00–19:00. Sunday will remain clearly more moderate throughout the day.
