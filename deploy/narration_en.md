*Next week, electricity prices will fluctuate significantly, with Monday standing out with the highest predicted prices, while Thursday and Friday offer the most affordable moments. Wind power production and price spikes significantly influence the development.*

Maintenance outages are currently underway at the Loviisa 1 and Loviisa 2 nuclear power plants. Loviisa 2's outage began on August 17, 2025, at 4:00 AM and is expected to end on September 9, 2025, at 12:00 AM. Loviisa 1's outage started on September 6, 2025, at 10:00 AM and is expected to conclude on September 24, 2025, at 12:00 AM. These outages may affect the accuracy of the forecast, as there is limited training data available during maintenance outages.

In the coming week, electricity price trends will be variable. **Monday** stands out as the most expensive day, with an average price rising to 7.2 cents. Monday is also predicted to have the highest maximum price at 16.4 ¬¢, possibly due to the low minimum wind power production, which remains at 380 MW. The risk of price spikes is high and may occur during morning or evening hours.

**Thursday** and **Friday** appear to be the week's most affordable days, with average electricity prices falling below half a cent. On these days, wind power production is strong, explaining the low prices. Friday's minimum price even drops into negative territory at -0.9 cents, which is noteworthy.

On **Sunday** and **Saturday**, price spikes may increase electricity prices during individual hours, even though the average price remains moderate. On Sunday evening, prices could rise up to 8.9 ¬¢. On Saturday evening, the maximum price is 9.0 ¬¢; this may occur as wind power production decreases.

The variation in average prices during the week provides consumers with opportunities to take advantage of cheaper hours. Fluctuations in wind power production clearly impact price formation, especially at the beginning of the week.
