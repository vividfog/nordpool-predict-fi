The upcoming week's electricity prices are expected to remain moderate, with the average price mostly below four cents. **On Sunday**, prices vary significantly throughout the day, with the most increases expected in the evening, when the price may rise above 10 cents. This could be due to low wind power production, which drops below 600 megawatts during the day.

**Tuesday** and **Wednesday** show similar price trends, but Wednesday is expected to have slightly more stable pricing, even though the risk of price spikes exists. On both days, wind power production varies significantly, which may affect price fluctuations.

**Thursday** and **Friday** are forecasted to have slightly higher average prices, but overall, they remain at reasonable levels. On Thursday, wind power production is slightly higher, which might smooth out price fluctuations.

At the end of the week, **Saturday** is expected to have the lowest average prices of the week, but even then, the risk of spikes exists, especially during the evening hours. Wind power production is expected to be relatively stable, which may curb price increases.
