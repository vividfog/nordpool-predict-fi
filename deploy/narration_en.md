*Electricity prices will experience clear fluctuations in the coming days: the week's highest prices will occur on Thursday evening, whereas Sunday will offer very affordable electricity. Significant variations in wind power production partly explain these price rises and falls.*

The Olkiluoto 2 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing a maintenance outage, which started on 25 May 2025 at 18:00 and is expected to end on 24 June 2025 at 09:00. At Olkiluoto 3, there is a production limitation, which began on 23 June 2025 at 06:00 and is anticipated to conclude on 25 June 2025 at 01:00. These maintenance and production limitations may affect the accuracy of the forecast, as training data from periods with outages are limited.

Electricity prices in the coming days will vary noticeably. The most expensive day of the week will be **Thursday**, when the average daily price reaches 6.8 cents per kilowatt-hour. Thursday's price peak occurs in the evening around 19:00–21:00, when prices briefly approach 15 cents. On the same day, wind power production will be very low at times, dropping as low as 397 megawatts, partially explaining the high evening price peak. Thursday carries a significant risk of price spikes.

On **Friday**, electricity price fluctuations will also be relatively large, although more moderate compared to Thursday. The daily average price will remain at 3.2 cents, but the maximum price will rise slightly over six cents between 22:00–24:00. The risk of price spikes on certain hours exists on Friday.

On **Saturday** and **Monday**, electricity average prices will remain moderate, at 2.3 cents on Saturday and 1.9 cents on Monday. Saturday's highest price, six cents, will occur in the evening between 19:00–21:00. On Monday, the price fluctuation will be somewhat smaller, and the day's peak price will remain under five cents. However, both days still involve a risk of isolated price spikes.

The most affordable day of the week will be **Sunday**, when the average electricity price is practically zero cents per kilowatt-hour. Prices on Sunday will remain negative for several hours from early morning until the afternoon, reaching a minimum of -1.1 cents. The day's highest price is slightly above one cent. Nevertheless, a risk of isolated hourly price spikes is also mentioned for Sunday.

On the first day of the week, **Wednesday**, prices will remain quite moderate, with an average price of only 1.4 cents. Price fluctuations will not reach particularly high levels, and the day's highest hourly price will be 3.5 cents at around 20:00.

Next week, on **Tuesday**, the average electricity price will again rise slightly to 3.2 cents. Price fluctuations will remain reasonable, with the day's most expensive hours occurring in the morning between 08:00–10:00, when the price will be slightly above five cents. Tuesday also carries a risk of isolated hourly price spikes.
