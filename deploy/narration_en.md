The upcoming week introduces interesting fluctuations in electricity prices. On **Sunday**, average prices are expected to be negative, which is rare. Prices will range between -1.0 and 0.6 cents. There is plenty of wind power, which contributes to keeping prices low. On **Monday**, the situation changes dramatically, with prices expected to climb as high as 15.2 cents. This is partly due to a reduced supply of wind power. Price spikes may occur, particularly during morning and evening hours.

**Tuesday** follows Monday's trend, with electricity prices potentially rising up to 15.8 cents. The low minimum level of wind power combined with a high maximum price heightens the risk of price spikes. On **Wednesday**, price levels stabilize somewhat, but the risk of price spikes remains, especially in the afternoon hours.

**Thursday** sees a continuation of similar price development, with the risk of price spikes persisting. The average electricity price is around 5.9 cents. On **Friday**, prices drop significantly, with an average price of only 2.0 cents. The weekend ends **Saturday** with a favorable price level, once again due to abundant wind power.

The week offers both affordable and expensive moments, so electricity consumers should be particularly vigilant on Monday and Tuesday evenings.
