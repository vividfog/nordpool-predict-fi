The electricity price forecast for the upcoming week will vary considerably between days. However, overall price levels will remain affordable, with daily average prices staying below five cents. The week's cheapest day will be **Saturday**, when the average electricity price drops below one cent. The week's lowest price level, even slightly negative (-0.1 Â¢), will occur on Saturday afternoon between 16:00 and 18:00.

The week's highest average prices will appear on **Wednesday**, with an average of 4.5 cents. The week's highest individual hourly price, approaching 10 cents (9.8 Â¢), will occur on Wednesday morning between 8:00 and 10:00. Wednesday carries a risk of price spikes, meaning individual hours may rise even higher than forecast.

On **Monday** and **Thursday**, certain hours will also see elevated prices. On Monday evening between 19:00 and 21:00, prices will approach nearly 9 cents, and on Thursday morning between 7:00 and 9:00, prices will rise above 7 cents. Both days carry a noted risk of price spikes, suggesting these hours could potentially exceed forecast levels. Conversely, **Tuesday** and **Friday** will be more stable, with no expected spike risk.

**Sunday** starts off the week calmly, with electricity prices remaining very low throughout the day. Sunday's average price will be around one cent, with no expected price spikes.

The week's price variations partly reflect fluctuations in wind power production. On Wednesday and Thursday, wind power production will be relatively low, somewhat elevating electricity prices. Saturday's especially low prices are partly explained by lower weekend demand.
