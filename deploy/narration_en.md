At the start of next week, electricity prices are predicted to be low, particularly on **Sunday** and **Monday**, when average prices remain below two cents. During these days, strong wind power helps keep prices low. Midweek, especially on **Wednesday**, the average price rises significantly to 6.9 cents, with possible price spikes during certain hours. On **Thursday**, the risk of price spikes is high, as the maximum price could reach up to 16.7 cents.

**Friday** and **Saturday** are forecasted to have higher average prices, with **Saturday** standing out with an average price of 13.2 cents. The high maximum price of 29.2 cents on this day, combined with low wind power production, increases the risk of price spikes. Over the weekend, the scarcity of wind power further pushes up prices, as reflected in the high price expectations for Saturday.

In summary, the beginning of the week offers consumers low electricity prices, but prices rise significantly towards the end of the week, partly due to fluctuations in wind power production and maintenance outages.
