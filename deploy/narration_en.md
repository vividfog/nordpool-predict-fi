The week's electricity price forecasts show clear variations between different days. **Monday** stands out with the highest average price, 10.9 cents per kilowatt-hour, and a maximum price rising to 23 cents. This could be partially explained by low wind power production, averaging 1738 megawatts. **Tuesday** is also expected to see price spikes, with an average price of 8.3 ¬¢/kWh. Wind power minimum on Tuesday is below 1000 MW, which may contribute to the price spikes.

From Wednesday to **Saturday**, prices remain moderate, with average prices ranging from 2.6 to 5.2 ¬¢/kWh. During these days, wind power availability is significantly better, supporting lower prices. **Friday** and **Saturday** are expected to be the cheapest days of the week, with average prices below four cents.

Next Sunday, prices are anticipated to remain low, with an average price of 2.7 ¬¢/kWh, and wind power production staying at a good level. At the start of the week, particularly next Monday, higher prices are expected, with a significant risk of price spikes.
