On **Friday** and **Saturday**, the daily average will sit at 7.8 cents, while on **Monday** the average will climb to 13.8 cents and on **Tuesday** to 15.0 cents. The lowest single hourly price in the whole period will fall on **Saturday**, when the lowest forecast is 3.7¢.

**Thursday** and **Tuesday** are public holidays, which may curb demand and thus the price. Thursday’s average will indeed remain at 8.3 cents, even though a risk of isolated price spikes has been noted within the day.

The highest peak hours will be concentrated at the start of next week. On **Monday**, the top forecast will reach 20.9 cents, and the highest hours are expected around 18:00–20:00. On **Tuesday**, the peak forecast is likewise high at 20.6 cents, and the risk is assessed to be most pronounced around 17:00–19:00. On these days, minimum wind generation will drop clearly below other days, which aligns with higher maximum hourly prices.
