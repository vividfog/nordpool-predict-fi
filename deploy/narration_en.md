The upcoming week's electricity price expectations vary significantly between different days. **Monday** stands out as the most expensive day of the week, with an average price rising to 12.5 cents per kilowatt-hour, and the maximum price could reach up to 23.1 cents. This may be due to the low wind power production, averaging only 440 megawatts. The risk of price spikes is high on Monday, especially in the morning from 8-10 and in the evening from 6-8.

**Tuesday**, on the other hand, offers cheaper electricity at an average of 7.6 cents, but the risk of price spikes remains, especially in the morning from 7-9 and in the evening from 6-8. Wind power production on Tuesday averages 1660 megawatts, helping to keep prices moderate, although individual peak hours may increase the price.

Towards the end of the week, prices on **Friday** and **Saturday** are significantly lower, averaging less than four cents per kilowatt-hour. Wind power production is stronger during this time, explaining the lower prices to some extent. Notably, Friday's maximum price remains at 6.1 cents, indicating a calm price development.

Average prices are generally moderate with a few exceptions, and weather conditions appear to remain cool, which does not significantly affect the price level. During the week, price fluctuations are at their greatest early in the week, while the end of the week looks more stable in terms of prices.
