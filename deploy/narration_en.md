The beginning of the week will look very expensive. The highest daily average will fall on **Tuesday**, when the average will rise to 26.3 cents and the day’s maximum will reach 42.1 cents. **Monday** will also see a high average of 24.3 cents, and the hourly forecast will show a peak of 38.8 cents. Very weak wind power will be visible in the background, because on **Monday** the wind minimum will drop to 478 megawatts and on **Tuesday** to 413 megawatts. A high risk of individual price spikes has been marked for both days, and in the forecast the highest hours will be timed roughly between 16:00 and 20:00 on Monday and roughly between 07:00 and 10:00 on Tuesday.

Later in the week the price level will fall. On **Thursday** the average will drop to 16.4 cents, and on **Saturday** the week will look cheapest with an average of 13.1 cents. The frost will tighten clearly, because the average temperature will stay below −10 degrees throughout the week and will dip coldest on **Friday** to −15.2 degrees. A price-spike risk has been marked for every day, and from **Wednesday** to Sunday the min–max ranges will nevertheless remain clearly smaller than at the start of the week.
