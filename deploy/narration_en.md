The week’s electricity price forecast would mostly remain at a low level. Most daily averages will stay under four cents. The lowest averages are expected for Friday at 0,8 ¢ and Saturday at 0,7 ¢, while Monday comes in at 3,8 ¢ and Tuesday and Wednesday at 1,3 ¢. Nights and early mornings are projected negative on several days: on **Sunday**, **Wednesday**, **Friday** and **Saturday** the minimums dip between -0,2…-0,6 ¢. Intraday variation otherwise stays modest, and wind power is on average plentiful (often above 3 000 MW), which supports the low price level.

The clearest exception will be **Thursday**, when individual hours are assessed to carry spike risk. The day’s maximum is forecast at 15,3 ¢, with the peak likely in the evening, roughly 17–19. Thursday’s average, 5,4 ¢, will also be higher than the rest of the week. Behind this is an unusually low minimum wind output, only 1 208 MW, which explains the higher hourly prices. On other days the highest hours remain clearly more moderate: on **Monday** the upper bound is 6,3 ¢, while on **Tuesday**, **Wednesday**, **Friday** and **Saturday** the maxima stay at or below 2,9 ¢. The week’s cheapest moments will cluster at night and in the early morning, while weekday evenings are slightly pricier apart from Thursday’s spike.
