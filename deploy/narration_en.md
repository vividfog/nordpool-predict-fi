In the coming days, electricity prices will vary significantly. **On Friday**, high price fluctuations are expected, with a peak price reaching 21.3 cents and an average price of 10.2 cents. This might be due to low wind power production during certain hours. **On Saturday** and **Sunday**, prices decrease, thanks to abundant wind power, keeping average prices modestly below six cents.

**On Monday**, the price level rises again to nearly eight cents, possibly due to reduced wind power availability. **On Tuesday**, prices slightly decrease, but on Wednesday, they rise again, with a peak price possibly reaching 17.2 cents.

**On Thursday**, the average price is the highest of the week at 11.4 cents, and the peak price could reach up to 20.2 cents. This may be due to continued low wind power production and potential price spikes.
