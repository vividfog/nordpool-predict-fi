The week's electricity price expectations vary significantly. **Saturday's** average price rises high to 10.4 cents, and the day's maximum price may surge to 21.9 cents during individual hours. This is due to low wind power production, dropping below 200 MW. **Sunday** is expected to be more affordable, with an average price of 4.2 cents and a minimum price possibly dropping to 0.6 cents. High wind power production figures on Sunday help keep prices low.

**Monday** is forecasted to have low prices with an average of 2.6 cents. Wind power is strong, supporting low price levels. **Tuesday's** price expectations are moderate, but there could be price spikes during individual hours, with an average price rising to 5.5 cents. **Wednesday** sees prices climbing again, with an average price of 7.5 cents, and wind power production remains at a lower level.

**Thursday's** forecast again looks affordable, with an average price of 2.8 cents. Wind power production is reasonable, supporting stable prices. The week's price expectations vary notably day by day, and particularly during the weekend, the risk of price spikes is considerable.
