Clear price differences will be expected during the week. On **Friday** the average price will be expected at 12,0 ¢ and the maximum at 21,8 ¢. Minimum wind output will be expected to drop to 481 MW, well below 2 000 MW. This will explain the higher peak. The risk of a price spike will be assessed as high, with the peak likely around 17:00–19:00. On **Tuesday** the average will be expected at 10,4 ¢ and the maximum at 17,9 ¢; winds are weak (avg 1,871 MW), so isolated peaks may occur around 10:00–12:00. On **Monday** a spike risk will also be seen, with the highest price likely around 17:00–19:00 (12,1 ¢).

A cheaper level will be expected over the weekend. On **Saturday** there will be a public holiday, which typically reduces demand and pushes the average to 4,7 cents; still, a single spike may land around midday at 11:00–13:00. On **Thursday** and during **Sunday** night hours, several hours will stay below five cents. On **Wednesday** the average will be expected to settle around 6,5 cents without unusual swings.
