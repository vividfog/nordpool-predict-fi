The Olkiluoto 2 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance. The maintenance outage began on 25.5.2025 at 18:00 and is expected to end on 24.6.2025 at 18:00. The maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of the forecast, as training data during outages is limited.

This week's electricity price forecast will show considerable variation between days. Average prices will range from under one cent to nearly eight cents per kilowatt-hour. Negative electricity prices will occur overnight between Wednesday and Saturday.

The most expensive day of the week will be **Thursday**, when the average electricity price will rise to 7.6 cents per kilowatt-hour. The highest single-hour price will also occur on the same day, potentially rising to over 16 cents. This peak price is expected to occur in the evening between 20:00 and 22:00. On **Friday**, high hourly prices will also occur around 8:00 in the morning, when prices may approach 17 cents. The high maximum prices on Thursday and Friday can be clearly attributed to low wind power production. Especially on Thursday, wind power output will drop to as low as 374 megawatts; on Friday, production will fall even lower, to just 195 megawatts.

The cheapest days of the week will be **Wednesday** and **Saturday**. On Wednesday, the average electricity price will remain at only 0.6 cents per kilowatt-hour, and during nighttime hours, prices will briefly turn negative, bottoming out at -0.6 cents. On Saturday, negative prices will also appear, with the lowest price reaching -0.3 cents between 14:00 and 16:00.

Over the weekend, electricity prices will remain generally low. Sunday's price expectation will be slightly higher than Saturday's, averaging 2.1 cents. Price variations on Sunday will be moderate, and the day's maximum price will remain well below four cents.

The beginning of next week will also feature affordable prices. On **Monday** and **Tuesday**, average prices will range between three and four cents, and individual peak hours are not forecasted to be particularly high. However, there remains a risk of price spikes on individual hours during both days, although maximum prices will only slightly exceed five and six cents.
