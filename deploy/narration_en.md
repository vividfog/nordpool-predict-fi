The upcoming week's electricity price development appears variable, but there are no major deviations in the forecasts. **Thursday** and **Monday** stand out with slightly higher average prices, around 3.4 ¢/kWh. These days are expected to have price fluctuations, with potential price spikes. On **Thursday** and **Monday**, the maximum price might rise up to 6.5 ¢/kWh and 7.3 ¢/kWh, possibly due to weaker wind power production on these days.

**Friday** and **Saturday**, on the other hand, represent a lower price level, with average prices around 1.9 ¢/kWh and 1.7 ¢/kWh. On these days, the amount of wind power is higher, which pushes the price down. **Friday's** wind power production is particularly strong, reducing the risk of price spikes.

**Sunday** stands out as the cheapest day of the week, with an average price of only 0.9 ¢/kWh. However, some individual price spikes are expected on Sunday, although they will remain moderate.

**Tuesday** and **Wednesday** see slightly higher price expectations but remain reasonable, averaging 2.9 ¢/kWh and 1.1 ¢/kWh. **Tuesday** might experience price fluctuations throughout the day, but **Wednesday** is forecasted to be a stable day without significant price spikes.
