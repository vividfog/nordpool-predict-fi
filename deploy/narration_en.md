The week will be mostly inexpensive, but early in the week prices will be higher. The most expensive day will likely be **Tuesday** with an average of 7,9 ¢, and on **Wednesday** the average will stay at 7,6 ¢. **Wednesday**, **Thursday** and **Friday** will be public holidays, which may lower demand and support lower prices. **Saturday** will stand out as the cheapest: an average of 2,9 ¢ and a daily ceiling of 4,5 ¢. The highest hourly prices of the week will fall on Wednesday, with the peak reaching 13,4 ¢.

Isolated price spikes will be possible on Tuesday morning: peaks will cluster around 08:00–10:00. Tuesday’s below-average wind power (about 2,366 MW) will partly explain the higher level. Thereafter, abundant wind output will weigh on prices: from Thursday onward daily averages will stay mostly below five cents, and over the weekend largely below four. The cheapest moments will occur especially on Saturday, when most hours will land between 1–4 ¢.
