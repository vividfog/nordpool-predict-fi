Prices are expected to split in two: the weekend will be inexpensive, and the start of the week will turn pricier. The cheapest days are expected to be **Saturday**, **Sunday** and **Friday**; Saturday’s average is 0,4 ¢, Sunday’s 2,9 ¢ and Friday’s 2,2 ¢. **Monday** and **Tuesday** are expected to be the most expensive, with averages of 9,8 ¢ and 9,6 ¢. Monday will also see the week’s highest hourly price, 15,7 ¢. **Wednesday** and **Thursday** are public holidays, with the price level expected to settle in the roughly 7–8 ¢ range.

Spike risk will be pronounced especially **Monday**, with the peak expected around 17:00–19:00. A low wind power minimum (1 057 MW) partly explains why Monday’s maximum price is the week’s highest, 15,7 ¢. **Tuesday** also carries spike risk, with the peak estimated around 08:00–10:00 (14,9 ¢). The week’s cheapest hours will cluster on the weekend: **Saturday**, abundant wind keeps prices in many hours below 1 ¢, and **Friday**, strong output supports a 1–3 ¢ level. **Wednesday** and **Thursday** are public holidays, which may ease demand and support more moderate prices.
