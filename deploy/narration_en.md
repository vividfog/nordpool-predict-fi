*Electricity prices on the power exchange will vary significantly in the coming days: Thursday and Friday will see the week's highest hourly prices, while Wednesday and the weekend will be very affordable, even featuring negative pricing. Early next week, prices will stabilize to moderate levels, though the risk of price spikes remains.*

The Olkiluoto nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance and experiencing reduced production. Olkiluoto 2 has been completely offline since May 25, 2025 at 18:00, and the maintenance outage is expected to end on June 24, 2025 at 18:00. In addition, Olkiluoto 3 is experiencing reduced output, with its current availability at 66.2 percent. This reduction began on June 23, 2025 at 06:00 and is expected to end on June 26, 2025 at 01:00. The ongoing maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as training data from periods of nuclear outages is limited.

The forecast was last updated on Tuesday at 14:24.

Electricity price expectations for the coming days will fluctuate significantly more than usual. The cheapest days of the week will be **Wednesday**, **Saturday**, and **Sunday**, with average prices clearly below two cents. Early Wednesday morning will even see negative hourly prices, reaching as low as -0.1 cents. The weekend pricing will remain moderate, though negative prices will also occur during individual hours on Saturday morning.

The highest prices of the week will occur on **Thursday** and **Friday**, when daily averages will rise above six cents. On Thursday, intraday variation will be particularly pronounced: prices are expected to exceed 12 cents during the morning hours between 08:00 and 10:00, and peak to as high as 14.4 cents between 19:00 and 21:00 in the evening. Thursday carries a high risk of price spikes, and actual peak prices may even exceed the forecasted values.

Friday will also see significant price fluctuations. Between 08:00 and 10:00 in the morning, electricity prices are expected to reach around 15 cents per kilowatt-hour at their highest. These elevated hourly prices on Friday are particularly due to exceptionally low minimum wind power production, only 150 MW.

At the start of next week, on **Monday** and **Tuesday**, electricity prices will return to more moderate levels. On Monday, the average price is forecasted to be around 3.5 cents, and on Tuesday, around 3.2 cents per kilowatt-hour. However, both days carry a noted risk of hourly price spikes, although prices will not reach as high as on Thursday and Friday.

Towards the end of the week, particularly the weekend, electricity prices will remain stable and affordable. On Saturday, the average price will be only 1.2 cents, and slightly higher on Sunday at 1.3 cents per kilowatt-hour. Individual higher-priced hours may still occur.
