The week’s priciest periods will land early. On **Tuesday** the average price is projected at 13,9 ¢ with a daily maximum of 21,4 ¢, in the evening at 18:00–20:00. Very low minimum wind output (637 MW) explains the high peak. On **Wednesday** the average is seen at 15,1 ¢ and the maximum at 20,1 ¢, most likely in the morning at 08:00–10:00. Spike risk will also apply to **Monday**, with the morning 08:00–10:00 the costliest (max 14,4 ¢), and to **Sunday**, where 08:00–10:00 reaches 9,6 ¢. In addition, Tuesday and Monday will likely see a second, smaller evening rise around 18:00–20:00. Spike risk is flagged for **Thursday** as well, with the morning 08:00–10:00 peaking (max 16,0 ¢).

The cheapest day is expected to be **Friday**, with a 3,7 ¢ average and prices mostly below four cents; the lowest occurs at 04:00–06:00 (min 2,3 ¢). A clear dip is also seen on **Thursday** from midday into afternoon, when levels fall to about 5,1 ¢ at 13:00–17:00. Saturday and Sunday will stay clearly below the early-week levels overall. Strong winds later in the week will press prices down, while weaker winds early in the week will show up as higher peaks.
