The upcoming week's price expectations vary significantly, with **Saturday** standing out with a high average price expected to be 15 ¬¢/kWh. The day's highest hourly price could exceed 30 cents, making it the most expensive day of the week. This is partly due to weak wind power, which averages below 1000 MW. There is also a significant risk of price spikes on **Saturday**, which may occur in the morning hours, particularly between 8-10 am.

High prices are also expected on **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, with average prices reaching 14 ¬¢/kWh and 14.5 ¬¢/kWh, respectively. On both days, wind power is forecasted to be at a low level, partly explaining the rising prices. **Tuesday** may experience price spikes particularly in the evening, between 6-8 pm.

**Friday** and **Sunday** have slightly lower average prices of just under 10 cents, but price spikes are forecasted on both days. **Friday's** highest price might occur during the morning hours between 10-12 am, while **Sunday** may see expensive afternoon hours between 6-8 pm.

The most affordable prices of the week are expected on **Thursday**, with the average price remaining below 7 ¬¢/kWh. Wind power production is high, which helps keep prices down. The highest prices are likely to occur in the evening between 6-8 pm.
