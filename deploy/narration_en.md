During the coming week, electricity prices will fluctuate. The week's lowest prices will occur early **Tuesday** morning between 03:00 and 05:00, when prices may even become negative, dropping as low as -0,6 cents per kilowatt-hour. This will partially be due to abundant wind power generation, expected to peak above 2400 megawatts on Tuesday.

The most expensive day of the week based on average price will be **Thursday**, when the average electricity price is forecasted to reach 5,4 cents. Thursday evening between approximately 19:00 and 21:00, prices will approach the week's highest individual hourly rate of 10,8 cents per kilowatt-hour. **Monday** will be slightly cheaper, with an average price of 5,1 cents, but Monday evening between 19:00 and 21:00, prices may rise above 11 cents. Specific risks for price spikes have been noted for Monday, Thursday, Sunday, and Wednesday.

On **Saturday**, prices will vary significantly throughout the day. Electricity will be cheapest during early morning hours, at less than one cent, but prices will rise temporarily to nearly 13 cents between 19:00 and 21:00. On **Sunday**, prices will generally remain low; however, an evening price increase to around 8 cents is expected between 19:00 and 21:00.

On **Wednesday**, the average price will be slightly above four cents, while early morning prices will remain low. During morning hours from 08:00 to 10:00, prices will reach the week's second-highest individual hourly rate of about 10,5 cents. On **Friday**, prices will remain more stable, averaging 4,7 cents, with no risk of price spikes specifically indicated.

Overall, the week will offer both affordable hours and a risk of price spikes, making it beneficial for electricity users to monitor prices actively. Negative prices early in the week may be especially interesting for flexible electricity consumers.
