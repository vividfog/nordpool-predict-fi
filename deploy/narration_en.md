The weekend price curve is expected to be even, but a few upticks are anticipated. **Saturday** is a public holiday, which typically lightens demand and supports moderate prices; the day’s average price is forecast at 5.6 ¢. However, a spike risk is assessed for individual hours, most likely at 23:00–01:00. **Sunday** will see modest variation, with a 4.6 ¢ average and minima dipping below three cents. The week’s lowest hourly price, 2.3 ¢, will occur in the 00:00–02:00 window on Sunday.

At the start of the new week the level will rise. **Monday** will average 8.3 ¢, with a morning spike risk at 08:00–10:00. **Tuesday** stands out clearly: an average of 10.9 ¢ and a peak of 19.8 ¢, most likely at 08:00–10:00. The high peak is explained by a very low wind-power minimum, only 843 MW. Wednesday’s maximum is forecast at 10.0 ¢ around midday hours, but the day will otherwise stay even. **Thursday** will see strong winds (daily production remains above 3,800 MW) pushing prices lower. **Friday** will average 8.2 ¢, with afternoon levels above 11 ¢ at 16:00–18:00. The lowest averages of the week will be on Thursday at 4.4 ¢ and on Sunday at 4.6 ¢, whereas Tuesday will rise to 10.9 ¢.
