Clear fluctuations will be seen at the start of the week. **Monday** is forecast to average 8,5 ¢ with a daily high of 15,5 ¢. There will be an elevated spike risk for individual hours, with the peak likely around 16:00–18:00. An exceptionally low wind-power minimum (918 MW) explains the high maximum price. **Tuesday** would average 7,8 ¢, and the 11,0 ¢ high will cluster around 07:00–09:00; a spike risk is also noted for this day. **Wednesday** is a public holiday, which typically eases demand; the average is projected at 7,1 ¢.

The rest of the week will turn inexpensive. **Thursday** and **Friday** (public holidays) will dip to 4,6 ¢ and 3,2 ¢ respectively as wind output is plentiful. **Saturday** will be the cheapest of the week: a 2,4 ¢ average with a 0,9–3,7 ¢ range. **Sunday** will stay low at 2,8 ¢ on average. The cheapest hours of the week will land on Saturday morning around 06:00–08:00, when prices will be about one cent. Overall, the early-week peaks will give way to the windier and more even late-week days.
