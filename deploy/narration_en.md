The week begins **Monday** with a moderate average price expected to be 3.3 cents per kilowatt-hour. The lowest prices occur at night, potentially falling into negative values. **Tuesday** sees a rise in prices with greater fluctuation, leading to potential price spikes around 8 AM and 6 PM. The average price is 6.6 cents, but the maximum price could reach 18.6 cents.

The most expensive day appears to be **Wednesday**, with an average price expected at 10.2 cents and the highest prices potentially reaching 19.7 cents. This is partly due to low wind power production, which varies significantly throughout the day. **Thursday** sees a slight decrease in prices with an average of 6.4 cents, but the possibility of price spikes remains.

The weekend brings significantly cheaper electricity prices. **Friday** has an average price of 2.7 cents, dropping to 0.6 cents on **Saturday**. **Sunday** maintains low prices, with an average of 0.8 cents. The abundance of wind power over the weekend partly explains the price decrease.
