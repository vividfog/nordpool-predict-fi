Overall, the week is forecast to bring mostly expensive exchange-traded electricity. The highest daily average will fall on **Tuesday**, when the average is expected to come in at 15.7 cents and the day’s peak will reach 22.8 cents. Tuesday is also a public holiday, which may keep demand lower than usual and support more moderate hours. The lowest daily average of the week will be seen on **Friday**, when the average will remain at 10.5 cents and the range will stay within 7.7–12.6 cents.

Price variation will build especially around the morning and afternoon. The risk of hourly price spikes is assessed as high on **Tuesday** (peak 08:00–10:00), **Wednesday** (08:00–10:00), **Thursday** (16:00–18:00), **Saturday** (16:00–18:00), **Sunday** (05:00–07:00), and next **Monday** (16:00–18:00). Saturday’s highs will also be explained by a clear dip in wind power, as the day’s minimum output will fall to 911 megawatts while the day’s peak price rises to 22.3 cents. Frosty readings will persist throughout the period, as every day’s average temperature is forecast to stay below -5°C.
