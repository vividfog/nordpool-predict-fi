The week will start on **Monday** with clearly lower prices. The dayâ€™s average price is forecast at 3,1 Â¢ with a range of 0,0â€“6,2 Â¢. After that, **Tuesday** will stand out as the clearly most expensive day of the week: the average rises to 16,6 Â¢ and the dayâ€™s peak reaches 29,8 Â¢. The minimum wind output will be very low (539 MW), which explains the higher level and intraday volatility.

The risk of high single-hour price spikes will be pronounced on **Tuesday**. The evening peak would most likely occur between 19:00â€“21:00, with elevated levels in the morning to midday around 9:00â€“11:00. An exceptionally low wind minimum combined with the highest peak price will raise the risk for individual hours.

On **Wednesday**, the risk of spikes will also stand out on individual hours. The dayâ€™s average is expected at 10,5 Â¢ with an upper bound of 22,2 Â¢. The wind minimum will also be low (565 MW), and the highest price would most likely fall in the morning hours around 8:00â€“10:00.

The most affordable days of the week will be on **Thursday** and **Sunday**, when averages drop to 2,5 Â¢ and 2,8 Â¢. Wind output will be plentiful then, which weighs on prices. **Friday** will sit in the middle (avg 4,2 Â¢), and intraday variation will remain moderate without spike risk.

The weekend will tighten on **Saturday** (avg 8,8 Â¢, maximum 15,4 Â¢) as the average wind output stays lower and the minimum dips to 632 MW. Higher hours will cluster in the afternoon and early evening; the peak would most likely fall between 15:00â€“17:00, with another accent around 18:00â€“20:00.

The weekâ€™s most expensive hours will cluster on Tuesday evening, while the cheapest periods are expected during the nights of the early and late week as well as many hours on Thursday and Sunday. A clear split between days will thus be seen alongside wind variation.
