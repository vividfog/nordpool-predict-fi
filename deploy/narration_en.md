The electricity price forecast over the next few days shows a clear downward trend towards the weekend. Early weekdays will have somewhat higher expected prices, but as the week progresses, the average electricity price will significantly decrease.

**Tuesday** will be the most expensive day of the week, with an expected average price of 5.1 cents per kilowatt-hour. Individual hours, however, may approach nearly 10¢, and the possibility of price spikes exists, particularly around 9 in the morning and again around 8 in the evening. Wind power generation on Tuesday will be very low, dropping to as little as 155 MW, partly explaining these higher peak prices.

On **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, prices will decrease slightly compared to Tuesday, with average prices just above four cents per kilowatt-hour. Both days will still see relatively high maximum prices, nearing 10 cents per kilowatt-hour. Potential price spike hours are Wednesday morning between 8–10 and Thursday morning between 8–10. Wind power will fluctuate these days and occasionally drop to very low levels, which in part may influence higher hourly prices.

As the week progresses, prices will clearly decline, with **Friday's** average price dropping below four cents. Although Friday's maximum price remains above six cents, the risk of significant spikes is lower compared to early in the week.

On **Saturday** and **Sunday**, electricity prices will drop to the week's lowest levels. On Saturday, the average daily price is forecasted to be just above two cents, and Sunday will fall below one cent. Sunday's forecast also includes negative prices during early morning hours, meaning electricity prices may briefly drop below zero.

Next **Monday**, prices will slightly rise from Sunday’s levels but remain moderate, with an average price below three cents. Price spikes may occur especially between 8 and 10 in the morning.
