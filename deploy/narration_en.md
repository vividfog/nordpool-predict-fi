The upcoming week's forecasts show price variations between days, with **Friday** standing out due to its higher average price of 7.5 ¢/kWh and a maximum price of 16.6 ¢. This is due to the low wind power production, which is at its minimum at 805 MW. Therefore, there is a high risk of price spikes on Friday, particularly in the morning between 8-10 AM, when electricity prices may rise significantly.

**Monday** could also experience price spikes during individual hours, and the day's average price is relatively high at 4.9 ¢/kWh. This is partly due to weak wind power, which varies between 343 MW and 3469 MW. Prices may rise during midday hours, especially between 8-10 AM, when the projected maximum is 13.7 ¢.

**Sunday** and **Tuesday** offer more favorable conditions for electricity users, with average prices at 1.1 ¢/kWh and 1.9 ¢/kWh, respectively. Both days are expected to have stronger wind power, helping to keep prices low. Minimum prices might even drop into negative on Sunday.

**Wednesday** and **Thursday** prices are more moderate, but there is a risk of price spikes during individual hours on both days. On Wednesday, the maximum price could rise to 11.5 ¢ between 8-10 AM, and on Thursday, to 9.9 ¢ during the same timeframe. Both days feature wide fluctuations in wind power, which may cause instability in prices.

Throughout the week, there will be variations in prices and wind power production, but particularly on Friday, potential price spikes should be noted. The week's most affordable moments are on Sunday and Tuesday, when wind power is at its strongest.
