Electricity prices will vary considerably in the coming days. The largest fluctuations are expected on **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, when peak hourly prices will rise clearly above 10 cents per kilowatt-hour. On both days, price peaks will occur during morning hours between 8 and 10, with prices ranging between 12 and 14 cents. Price spikes could occur, meaning hourly prices might rise higher than forecasted.

As the week progresses, prices will notably decrease. On **Friday**, the average price will be around three cents, and during the weekend prices will drop exceptionally low. On **Saturday**, even negative prices will occur, with the lowest price dipping to -0,7 cents. The day's average price will remain below one cent, making Saturday the cheapest day of the week.

Negative electricity prices will be seen also on **Sunday**. The day's lowest price reaches -0,5 cents, though the average rises slightly to around one and a half cents. Sunday's maximum price will still remain low, only 4,6 cents.

At the start of the following week, prices will rise slightly compared to the weekend but will remain relatively affordable. On **Monday**, the average price will be 3,4 cents, and on **Tuesday**, 3,2 cents. On both days, peak hourly prices will stay moderate, just above five cents.

Overall, the upcoming week will be clearly divided into two parts: high prices and significant risks of price spikes early in the week, contrasted by exceptionally low and occasionally negative prices during the weekend. Such notable variation makes the coming days particularly interesting for electricity consumers, with the weekend's exceptionally low prices standing out clearly in the forecast.
