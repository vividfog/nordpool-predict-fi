The start of the week will be higher than the other days. On **Tuesday** the average price is forecast at 7,9 ¢ and the maximum at 11,1 ¢, concentrated in the 08:00–10:00 window. On Tuesday the wind will be weak on average, which supports the higher level. On **Wednesday** the average will be 8,1 ¢ and the peak of 14,8 ¢ will most likely fall between 08:00 and 10:00. The day is a public holiday, but the minimum wind output will be very low, at 1 268 MW, which explains the peak. Spikes in individual hours are expected in the morning hours.

From **Thursday** onward, the price level will turn markedly lower. The day is a public holiday, as is **Friday**, and wind generation will be abundant, so the daily average would settle at 3,8 ¢ on both days. On **Saturday** the average will be 2,8 ¢ and on **Sunday** 3,4 ¢. On **Monday** the level will rise slightly to 4,3 ¢. Hourly prices will mostly stay below 7,4 ¢ from Thursday to Sunday and below 6,1 ¢ on Monday. Overall, the latter part of the week will look affordable, while the clearly highest moments fall on Wednesday morning.
