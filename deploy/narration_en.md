The electricity price expectations for the next week appear varied. **Thursday** stands out as particularly affordable, with an average daily price expected to be just 0.5 cents, and the price range is -1.3 to 1.7 ¢. This is due to abundant wind power production, averaging 2625 MW. **Tuesday**, on the other hand, is the most expensive day of the week, with the average price rising to 6.3 cents. Tuesday's price expectations are influenced by the low minimum wind power of 919 MW, which partly explains the higher maximum prices.

On **Monday** and **Tuesday**, price spikes are expected during certain hours, so electricity users should be cautious. For example, on Monday, the highest expected hourly price is 13.1 ¢, and on Tuesday, it rises to as much as 14.5 cents. **Saturday** and **Sunday** also carry a risk of price spikes, although somewhat more moderate than at the beginning of the week.

The week begins on **Monday** with an average price of 5.5 cents, which is slightly higher than over the weekend but remains well below Tuesday's level. **Wednesday** sees prices stabilize again, with the day expected to be affordable at 3.1 cents. This suggests that price fluctuations are greater at the beginning of the week but level off as the week progresses. The weekend is relatively reasonably priced, though individual price spikes should be noted from Saturday to Sunday.
