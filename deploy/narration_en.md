The week’s price profile will split in two: higher levels early in the week, while the end of the week will remain clearly lower. **Tuesday** will average 7,9 cents, and the day’s high of 12,2 ¢ will occur in the morning around 7–9. The backdrop will be weak wind: minimum wind production will drop to just 436 megawatts, which will explain Tuesday’s higher peak versus other days.

**Wednesday** and **Thursday** will average 1,3–1,8 cents. Wind output above 3 000 MW will be strong from Wednesday to Saturday, pushing prices down: **Friday’s** average will be 0,9 cents and **Saturday** 2,1 cents. Negative prices will appear in the early morning hours on Thursday and Friday, and on **Sunday** as well. From Sunday afternoon into early evening, around 17–19, prices will again rise above 10 ¢, even though the daily average will be 4,2 ¢. Next **Monday** the average will climb to 5,0 ¢ and the day’s top hour will reach 8,1 ¢.
