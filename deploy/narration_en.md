Clear variation will be seen during the week: the lowest average prices will be especially on **Wednesday** (2,4 ¢) and over the weekend, while **Friday** (9,9 ¢) and **Tuesday** (12,0 ¢) will be pricier. Abundant wind power on Wednesday will explain the low price level. **Saturday** will be a public holiday, and the average price is expected to settle at 4,8 cents. The most distinctive day of the week will be **Tuesday**, with a projected maximum of 19,7 ¢.

The risk of price spikes will stand out on Friday and Tuesday during single hours. On Friday, the peak will land in the morning between 9–11 (daily high 15,8 ¢) and another prominence in the evening 16–18. On Tuesday, the major rise will hit the morning 8–10 (peak 19,7 ¢), and a new rise will be expected in the evening 17–19. **Saturday** may see single-hour spikes, most likely around midday 10–12. The higher peaks on Friday and Tuesday will also be explained by very low minimum wind production, which will drop clearly below 2000 MW on both days.
