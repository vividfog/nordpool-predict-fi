Price development over the week will be variable. Average prices will range from about 1,6 cents on **Thursday** to 13,0 cents next **Tuesday**. Overall, both low and clearly higher daily prices will be seen, and intraday variation will stand out particularly on lower-wind days.

The most distinctive day will be **Wednesday**, with the average estimated at 11,4 Â¢ and the maximum at 30,4 Â¢. The dayâ€™s wind minimum will fall to 686 MW, well below 2000 MW, which will help explain the higher intraday peak.

On **Thursday** prices will drop to an exceptionally low 0,2â€“3,3 Â¢ range. Strong wind output (4090â€“5969 MW, average 5085 MW) will support this level, and the average is expected to stay at 1,6 Â¢.

For **Friday**, spikes are anticipated for individual hours late in the morning around 08:00â€“10:00, with a maximum reaching 19,6 Â¢. The wind low will drop to 724 MW, below 2000 MW, which can explain the higher peak. Also on **Saturday**, spike risk will fall in the morning around 08:00â€“10:00; the maximum is estimated at 15,5 Â¢ and the wind minimum is 1200 MW.

On **Sunday**, the price level will remain fairly even between 2,5â€“6,8 Â¢. Next **Monday** the risk will stand out in the evening around 18:00â€“20:00, with the peak rising to 23,4 Â¢ and the wind minimum at 775 MW. Next **Tuesday** the spike risk will lean to the morning around 08:00â€“10:00, with the maximum at 22,3 Â¢ and the wind minimum 1095 MW. The higher peaks on these days will be partly explained by wind production minima below 2000 MW.
