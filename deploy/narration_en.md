The week is expected to start on an elevated level: on **Tuesday**–**Friday** the average price is projected at 11,2–13,7 cents. A high risk of price spikes is indicated for these days. The highest peak, 22,3 ¢, falls on Tuesday, whose average is 13,7 ¢; this is backed by an exceptionally low minimum wind output of 247 MW. Spikes are expected to cluster on Tuesday at 17:00–19:00 and on Friday at 16:00–18:00. On **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, peaks will also concentrate in the morning, around 08:00–10:00. Early-week averages will be supported by weak winds, at times near calm (<1000 MW).

Toward the weekend, prices are expected to ease. On **Saturday** the average is 7,1 ¢, and isolated spikes may occur in the morning at 08:00–10:00. On **Sunday** the level will be the week’s lowest, averaging 3,7 ¢, with the cheapest hours at 01:00–03:00, dipping below three cents. Next **Monday** the average should stay moderate at 7,3 ¢. On Sunday and Monday, abundant wind (over 3000 MW on average) will explain the lower price level.
