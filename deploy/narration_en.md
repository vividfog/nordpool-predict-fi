The week will begin on a low note: **Saturday** is projected to average 0,3 cents, with a few negative hours expected around 00:00–02:00. **Sunday** and **Monday** will stay below four cents, while **Tuesday** is expected to settle near 2,7 cents. Prices will rise clearly midweek: on **Wednesday** the average will move above five cents and the top hour to 8,7 cents. Early-week lows will be supported by very strong wind on Saturday, which explains the exceptionally low average.

Late in the week, volatility will stand out. On **Thursday** a spike risk is noted, with the peak likely in the morning around 08:00–10:00 (forecast high 9,6 ¢). **Friday’s** risk is flagged clearly: in the evening around 17:00–19:00 the peak is estimated at 18,4 cents. Friday’s high maximum will be linked to a very low wind minimum of 863 megawatts, which would explain the unusually high peak. Overall, the early week will look inexpensive; Thursday will turn pricier, and Friday will be the week’s costliest day with the average rising to 10,3 cents.
