The upcoming week will bring varied electricity prices, with **Monday's** high average price of 5.6 ¢ standing out among the other days. This could be due to the low wind power production, forecasted to be at its lowest at 477 MW on Monday. Price spikes may also occur on Monday, with one potentially in the morning between 9-11 AM and another in the evening between 7-9 PM, when electricity prices are expected to exceed 10 ¢.

**Thursday** offers the lowest prices of the week, with an average price of only 1.6 ¢. This is influenced by strong wind power, predicted to peak at 3039 MW. On **Saturday**, prices will also remain low, with an average price of just 0.3 ¢ and wind power reaching a maximum of 3466 MW.

Sunday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday present moderate average prices, ranging from 2.1 ¢ to 4.6 ¢, with price fluctuations remaining modest and without significant spikes. In the latter part of the week, particularly on **Thursday** and **Saturday**, low prices and strong wind power suggest affordable electricity.
