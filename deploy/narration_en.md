**Thursday's** forecast indicates that prices will rise significantly at times, with the highest expected price reaching 16.9 Â¢/kWh. In this context, wind power production may decrease significantly, dropping to as low as 539 MW, which contributes to the price increase. **Friday** is expected to be the most expensive day of the week, with an average price of 11.6 Â¢/kWh. The highest price could rise to 22 Â¢, due to low wind power production, which occasionally falls to just 170 MW. On both days, price spikes are possible, especially during the evening hours.

During the weekend, **Saturday** and **Sunday**, electricity prices are anticipated to be significantly lower. Saturday's average price is forecasted at only 1.1 Â¢/kWh, making it the most affordable day of the week. Sunday's average price is slightly higher at 2 Â¢/kWh, but still at an inexpensive level. High wind power production levels are a major factor in the low prices, and the risk of price spikes is minimal.

Next **Monday**, a slight increase in prices is expected, with an average price of 3.8 Â¢/kWh. Wind power production is expected to remain high, which helps keep prices reasonable. **Tuesday's** price forecast shows a risk in the evening, with prices potentially reaching 17.7 Â¢/kWh. However, the day's average price remains moderate at 5.8 Â¢/kWh. **Wednesday**'s prices are expected to rise slightly, with an average price of 7.4 Â¢/kWh. Variations in wind power production may contribute to the price increase, especially during the day.
