The upcoming week brings moderate electricity price forecasts with no significant peaks. **Sunday** sees a wide price range with expected price spikes, even though the average price is low. This is likely due to minimal wind power production during certain hours. **Monday** continues with a slightly higher average price, but the risk of price spikes is minimal, which may encourage consumers to take advantage of low-price hours during the day.

**Tuesday** and **Wednesday** follow a similar price trend, but the risk of price spikes on Wednesday may raise prices during specific hours. Wind power production is reasonable on these days, supporting stable prices.

**Thursday** is expected to have the highest average price of the week, partly due to possible price spikes during the day. Wind power production is slightly lower, which partly explains the rise in prices. **Friday**, on the other hand, brings prices back to the level seen at the start of the week, although the risk of price spikes remains.

Over the weekend, **Saturday** again offers a more affordable average price, though the risk of price spikes is still present. This may provide opportunities for those who can time their consumption accurately.
