Electricity market prices in the coming week will vary notably from day to day. **Saturday** will be the most affordable day of the week, with an average electricity price below one cent per kilowatt-hour. Prices throughout Saturday will remain consistently low, even dropping to as low as 0,2 cents at certain hours.

In contrast, **Wednesday** will see the highest electricity prices of the week. The average price on Wednesday is expected to be 6,2 cents, and the day also includes the week's highest single-hour price spike. According to forecasts, peak prices will occur on Wednesday morning between approximately 8:00 and 10:00, potentially reaching up to 15 cents per kilowatt-hour. Wednesday's notably high maximum price is linked to particularly low wind power output during the morning hours.

**Thursday** and **Friday** will also see elevated prices at certain times of the day. On Thursday, peak prices are expected in the evening around 19:00–21:00, approaching seven cents. On Friday morning between approximately 8:00 and 10:00, prices are anticipated to approach nearly ten cents.

**Sunday** stands out due to its negative minimum price occurring overnight, roughly between 1:00 and 3:00. During this period, electricity prices will dip as low as -0,5 cents per kilowatt-hour. This negative pricing event is temporarily driven by higher wind power production during nighttime hours.

The remaining days of the week, **Tuesday** and next **Monday**, will have relatively stable prices. Tuesday's average price will stay under four cents, while on Monday, the average will settle just above three cents. Significant price fluctuations or spikes are not expected on these days.

The fluctuation in prices suggests that timing electricity usage carefully in the coming days could significantly impact electricity bills. Monitoring price developments closely can help consumers effectively utilize the most affordable hours.
