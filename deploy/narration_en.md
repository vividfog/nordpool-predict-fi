Average spot electricity prices will remain at a very expensive level throughout the period. The most expensive day will be **Wednesday**, when the average price will rise to 34.9 cents and the day’s highest hourly price will reach 55.8 cents. On Wednesday, the peak will fall in the late morning in the forecast, roughly between 07:00 and 09:00. The day will also stand out with the clearly lowest wind-power minimum, 594 MW. That aligns with the high maximum price.

From Thursday onward, average prices will drop closer to the 18.6–25.0 cent range. The cheapest day will be **Sunday**, when the average price will settle at 18.6 cents and the maximum will stay at 26.5 cents. Hard frost will be forecast across the whole period, with average temperatures holding around -10.5 to -11.5 degrees. The risk of price spikes will be high on every day, and the most pronounced spike window will appear on Wednesday morning.
