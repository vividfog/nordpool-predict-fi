During the upcoming week, electricity market prices will notably fluctuate from day to day. Clear differences in average price levels as well as price variability can be observed between the days.

The cheapest day of the week will be **Tuesday**, when the average electricity price is expected to drop to only around 2.4 cents per kilowatt-hour. During nighttime and early morning hours on Tuesday, the electricity price may fall even below half a cent. The day's maximum price will also stay just slightly above five cents, making Tuesday distinctly the most affordable day of the week.

Other weekdays are fairly similar to each other, but **Thursday** stands out due to its highest average price. On Thursday, the average electricity price will rise to approximately 7.2 cents. Price variation within the day will also be significant: morning hours between 8–10 and evening hours between 18–20 will likely be the most expensive, exceeding 10 cents per kilowatt-hour.

Weekend days, **Saturday** and **Sunday**, will also experience relatively large price variations. On Saturday, prices will range between 1.3 and 12.2 cents during the day. The highest prices are expected in the evening between 19–21. Sunday's price pattern is similar, with the highest prices occurring in the evening around 19–21, when prices exceed 11 cents.

On **Monday**, **Wednesday**, and **Friday**, prices will remain somewhat moderate, but daily peaks will nevertheless exceed 10 cents. Average daily prices will settle between 5.5–5.8 cents, somewhat higher than during the weekend but clearly lower than on Thursday.

The risk of price spikes is particularly high on Saturday and Sunday during certain individual hours, but price spikes might also occur occasionally on Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday. On Tuesday and Friday, however, the risk is very low, and price spikes do not need to be specifically mentioned regarding these days.
