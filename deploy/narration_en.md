The week will start with **Friday** clearly more expensive: the average price is expected at 17.9 ¢ and the peak at 30.8 ¢. The day’s top price will be explained by an exceptionally low wind-power minimum (380 MW), and wind will stay on a calm average level for the day. The lowest average prices will fall on **Saturday** (8.2 ¢) and **Thursday** (9.2 ¢), when abundant wind is anticipated and prices will remain lower. Midweek, on Tuesday and Wednesday, averages will climb to 15.0–15.3 ¢.

Price-spike risk will stand out on several days. **Sunday** may see a spike in the morning around 08:00–10:00. **Monday** will most likely peak in the morning at 08:00–10:00. **Tuesday** carries a high risk, with an evening peak around 17:00–19:00. **Wednesday** will most likely rise in the morning at 08:00–10:00. **Thursday** may feature a single bump around midday at 11:00–13:00. Overall, the week’s most expensive moment will fall on Friday afternoon–evening, while Saturday and Thursday daytime hours are expected to be the most moderate.
