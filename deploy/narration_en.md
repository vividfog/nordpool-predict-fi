*Next week's electricity prices will fluctuate from moderate to higher levels, particularly on Wednesday and Thursday when the risk of price spikes is elevated. Monday and Tuesday's prices will remain lower, supported by wind power production.*

The Loviisa 1 nuclear power plant is undergoing maintenance, which began on September 6, 2025, at 10:00 AM and is expected to end on September 24, 2025, at 12:00 AM. Similarly, Loviisa 2 has been under maintenance since August 17, 2025, at 4:00 AM and is set to end on September 17, 2025, at 12:00 AM. These maintenance outages may affect the accuracy of forecasts, as there is limited training data available during maintenance periods.

In the early part of next week, expected electricity prices will be moderate, but on **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, prices will rise to a noticeably higher level. On **Wednesday**, the average price is expected to be 6.0 ¬¢/kWh, with the highest price potentially reaching up to 13.2 ¬¢. This could be partly due to low minimum wind power production, which will be below 1000 MW in the morning. On **Thursday**, the average price will remain at 5.9 ¬¢/kWh, with a maximum price of 11.1 ¬¢. Both days are noted for a risk of price spikes, especially during morning and evening hours.

The other days of the week will have a more stable price development. For example, on **Monday** and **Tuesday**, prices will be at a lower level, with average prices staying below 2.5 ¬¢/kWh. During the weekend, prices will not significantly deviate from the level at the start of the week, and the risk of price spikes will be minimal.

The week will start and end with more stable price developments, but especially on **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, it will be advisable to prepare for potential price spikes. Variations in wind power production will partly influence price expectations.
