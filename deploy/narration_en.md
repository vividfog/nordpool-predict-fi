The week is expected to start off inexpensive: **Sunday’s**, **Monday’s** and **Friday’s** average prices will stay below four cents. On **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, averages will rise clearly, to 8,1 and 8,8 ¢. Tuesday’s higher level will be explained by weak wind (average 2294 MW). On Thursday the price level will settle around five cents. The cheapest individual hours are forecast for early morning on Monday and Saturday, when prices will dip to about 1,4–1,9 ¢.

The risk of spikes will stand out on two days. On **Tuesday**, a pronounced morning peak is expected around 07:00–09:00, with a forecast high of 12,3 ¢. On **Saturday**, the risk will concentrate in the afternoon around 16:00–18:00, and the projected high is 13,5 ¢. On Saturday, minimum wind production will drop to 958 MW, which explains the week’s highest maximum price. At other times, prices are expected to move moderately without exceptional extremes.
