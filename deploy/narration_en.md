The highest average price of the week is expected on **Monday**, when the daily average will come in at 15.7 cents and the maximum is forecast at 25.9 ¢. The price level will be pushed up in particular by the day’s exceptionally low wind-power minimum of 443 MW. A high risk of hourly price spikes is also flagged for this day, and in the hourly forecast the peak falls in the late morning, roughly from 08:00 to 10:00.

**Tuesday** is a public holiday, and demand may be lower than normal, which could pull prices down. Even so, the day is forecast to average 13.9 cents with a 19.9 ¢ maximum, and a spike risk is also highlighted for Tuesday. On **Wednesday**, the range stretches to 7.9–22.1 cents, and the spike risk will be concentrated in the late morning in the hourly forecast, roughly from 09:00 to 11:00. On **Sunday**, the risks will focus on the evening, when the price is forecast to be highest around 19:00–21:00.
