The price trend for the week is variable, but the most significant fluctuations occur on **Tuesday** and **Thursday**, when maximum prices rise above 17 cents. Of these days, **Tuesday** is particularly notable, as the day's minimum price is just 0.6 ¢, creating significant variability in daily prices. Wind power production is at its lowest on Tuesday at 755 MW, partially explaining the high price spikes.

On **Wednesday**, price expectations are more moderate, with an average price of 7.1 cents and higher average wind power production, which stabilizes price trends. **Friday** and **Saturday** are also expected to see moderate prices, but the low average price forecasted for Saturday, at 5.4 ¢, makes it the cheapest day of the week.

**Sunday** appears to be the most affordable day of the week, with an average price of only 3.9 ¢, and price fluctuation remains minimal, reducing the risk of surprises. On **Monday**, prices remain reasonable, averaging 4.3 ¢.

During the week, price spikes typically occur during morning and evening hours, so consumers should stay alert during these times.
