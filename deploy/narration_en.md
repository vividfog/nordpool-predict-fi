The week will start at a clearly higher level and will get cheaper quickly towards the end. On **Monday**, the average price will be 7,4 ¢ with a range of 1,2–11,8 ¢. For individual peak hours the forecast indicates a spike risk: the most expensive window would land in the afternoon around 16–18, when the level would rise clearly above ten cents. The cheapest hours will fall at night right at the start of the day.

Already on **Tuesday** prices will shift to a cheaper direction. The average will be 4,2 ¢ and the day’s top 11,3 ¢, but the overall level will be lower than Monday. Wind output will be ample from Tuesday onward, which typically depresses prices. On **Wednesday**, prices will be at the week’s low: the day’s average will be 1,2 cents and during the early night it would be around zero and briefly negative, at a low of −0,3 ¢. Wind will be clearly abundant (about 4 600–5 700 MW), which supports the low level.

**Thursday** will bring a slight rise, but the average will remain at 3,3 cents. Intraday variation will be moderate with the day’s high at 6,4 ¢. The end of the week will be broadly inexpensive: **Friday’s** average will be 1,8 ¢ with a range of 0,6–2,9 ¢. **Saturday** will remain at roughly the same level, with individual hours peaking at 4,5 ¢.

The week will end still cheap. On **Sunday**, the average will be 1,6 ¢ and the day’s top 2,9 ¢. There will be many cheap hours from Friday to Sunday, often well under two cents. The most affordable stretches will fall in Wednesday’s night and early morning, whereas the week’s only clearly pricier full day will be Monday with its afternoon peaks. Realized prices may still move if the wind forecast changes.
