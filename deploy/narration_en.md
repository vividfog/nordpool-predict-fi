The week will start evenly. On **Monday** the average price is expected to be 5,6 ¢, with modest intraday variation. On **Tuesday** the level will rise clearly: the average is projected at a costly 11,4 ¢ and the daily high will reach 18,8 ¢. A high spike risk will be seen on individual hours, with the peak expected around 17–19. Behind this is weak wind: as wind power minimum drops to 288 MW, the higher maximum price is explained.

On **Wednesday** the spike risk will continue. The daily maximum is 15,2 ¢, and it is expected to occur in the morning around 07–09, when wind output is at its lowest (237 MW). Friday and Saturday will stay mid-range, with averages of 6,2 ¢ and 6,0 ¢ and daily highs of 11,8 ¢ and 10,2 ¢. On **Thursday** the average will dip to 3,1 ¢ and on **Sunday** to 3,7 ¢, which is explained by abundant wind. The week’s cheapest hours will fall at night: early Thursday hours will be around 1 ¢. Price estimates may still change if the wind forecast changes.
