Clear variation is forecast for the week. Prices are expected to peak at the start, then ease markedly as wind output strengthens. The end of the week will include very low days, and early next week levels will edge higher again.

On **Tuesday** the average price is expected to climb to 24.8 ¢, the week’s highest. Wind power is projected at just 499–1493 MW (avg. 870 MW), i.e., calm conditions. The very low minimum output will also explain the day’s extremely high peak. The most expensive hours will cluster in the evening around 18–20, when the forecast peak reaches 57.2 ¢. Intraday variation will be wide: the cheapest hour will be 10.3 ¢.

On **Wednesday** the average would drop to 12.3 ¢. A high risk of price spikes is indicated for the day, especially in the morning around 08–10. The forecast peak is 24.1 ¢, while wind power’s lower bound remains 688 MW and output strengthens toward the evening.

**Thursday** forms the week’s floor: an average of 1.6 ¢ and a range of 0.1–3.3 ¢. Strong winds (3962–5888 MW) will press prices all day. **Friday** is seen at 5.1 ¢, with a narrow 2.6–7.3 ¢ range. **Sunday’s** average would be 3.4 ¢, moving between 2.5–4.3 ¢ throughout the day. On these days wind output is abundant, supporting low levels.

On **Saturday** winds will be weaker (avg. 2209 MW), and the average is expected to rise to 8.7 ¢. A high risk of isolated spikes is indicated, most likely in the evening around 18–20, when the day’s peak reaches 15.0 ¢. Next **Monday** shows a similar setup: a 11.1 ¢ average, wind minimum 805 MW and a 21.5 ¢ peak, with spike risk around the evening high at 18–20. Price expectations may still shift, especially if wind forecasts change.
