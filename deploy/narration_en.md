The electricity markets for the coming days appear varied. The forecast for **Friday** shows a wide price range, with prices potentially fluctuating from negative values to over 15 cents. This could lead to isolated price spikes, particularly in the morning from 8-10 a.m. and in the evening from 6-8 p.m. The amount of wind power is variable and may explain some of the price fluctuations.

**Saturday** is forecasted to have a higher average price, potentially exceeding 20 cents. Limited wind power during the morning and afternoon may partly drive prices up. **Sunday** is expected to be more moderate in terms of prices, though spikes could occur, especially in the afternoon.

**Monday** is predicted to have a higher price trend compared to the weekend, with a risk of price spikes. Wind power production may partially stabilize price fluctuations, but there is a risk of price increases, especially in the morning and evening.

**Tuesday** is expected to have a more moderate price trend, although spikes could occur in the afternoon. **Wednesday** and **Thursday** promise low average prices without major spikes, making them the most affordable days of the week.
