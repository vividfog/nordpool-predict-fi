In the coming week, electricity prices are expected to vary. **Thursday** will see the lowest electricity price of the week, with the average price near zero cents per kilowatt-hour. This is primarily due to a large wind power production exceeding 3000 MW, which has a downward effect on prices. On **Friday**, the price rises significantly, with a maximum price expected to reach 6.8 cents. On this day, wind power is at a minimum, below 800 MW, which partly explains the higher price level.

On **Saturday** and **Sunday**, the price drops again, but on Sunday, there is a risk of price spikes during individual hours. Over the weekend, wind power production is relatively low, which may contribute to the emergence of price spikes. On **Monday**, the average price rises again, but wind power is expected to remain low throughout the day, which may explain the slightly higher daily price.

**Tuesday** and **Wednesday** see prices declining once more, with wind power production increasing on Wednesday, which may have a downward impact on prices. However, the risk of price spikes remains present on Tuesday, especially during morning and evening hours.

The upcoming week presents various price fluctuations and potential price spikes, which should be considered in electricity consumption.
