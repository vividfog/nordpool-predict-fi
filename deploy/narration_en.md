The upcoming week presents varied electricity price prospects. **Tuesday** stands out with a high average price of 8.7 cents, and the daily maximum price might reach up to 29.4 cents. This is partly due to the low minimum wind power production (923 MW), which may cause price spikes, particularly in the evening between 5 PM and 7 PM. **Wednesday** is expected to continue with high prices, with an average price of 12.0 cents. Price spikes are also expected on Thursday, but the average price drops to 5.2 cents.

The most affordable days of the week are **Friday** and **Saturday**, when average prices remain below one cent, with Friday at 0.9 cents and Saturday at 0.4 cents. During these days, strong wind power production contributes to lower prices. The weekend concludes on Sunday with moderate price expectations, with an average price of 3.2 cents.

Overall, the week brings both high and low prices, and particularly on Tuesday and Wednesday, one should be prepared for potential price spikes. The week's price expectations vary significantly between days, making the electricity market an interesting one to watch.
