**On Thursday**, the electricity price is expected to fluctuate between 2.5 and 16.8 cents per kilowatt-hour, with an average price of 7.7 cents. However, price spikes may occur during individual hours, particularly between 8-10 AM and 6-8 PM. **On Friday**, a higher average price of 13.1 cents is predicted, and low wind power production may increase the price. The highest price spike on Friday may occur between 8-10 AM and 6-8 PM.

**Saturday** offers an affordable price trend, with an average price of only 1.5 cents. Wind power is abundant, which is reflected in the low price levels. **On Sunday**, the price levels remain low, with an average price of 2.5 cents.

**On Monday**, the average electricity price slightly increases to 4.2 cents but remains below 5 cents. **On Tuesday**, price fluctuations are expected to grow, and the day's highest price may exceed 19 cents. This is likely due to low wind power production in the morning and evening. **On Wednesday**, prices continue to rise, with an average price of 9.1 cents. The risk of price spikes is high, especially during the morning and evening hours.
