| **Saturday** | 0,6 | 0,1 - 1,4 | 1482 - 4614 | 6,6 |
| **Sunday** | 1,9 | -0,4 - 4,9 | 2909 - 5567 | 5,0 |
| **Monday** | 6,5 | 2,3 - 11,0 | 1752 - 2881 | 4,7 |
| **Tuesday** | 9,7 | 2,6 - 25,6 | 623 - 3481 | 4,7 |
| **Wednesday** | 9,5 | 4,4 - 17,7 | 1040 - 2496 | 5,1 |
| **Thursday** | 5,1 | 1,7 - 10,4 | 1160 - 3347 | 4,8 |
| **Friday** | 9,9 | 2,0 - 18,8 | 877 - 2858 | 4,3 |

In the overall picture, the most affordable periods will cluster over the weekend: **Saturdayâ€™s** average price is projected at 0.6 Â¢ and **Sundayâ€™s** at 1.9 Â¢. On Sunday, plentiful wind generation is expected, which will likely explain the low level. Prices will briefly dip below zero overnight, roughly at 02:00â€“04:00.

At the start of next week, levels will rise. **Mondayâ€™s** average would settle at 6.5 Â¢, and singleâ€‘hour highs would be possible in the morning at 08:00â€“10:00 and in the evening at 17:00â€“19:00 (daily maximum 11.0 Â¢). Wind output is expected to average below 2,500 MW, which can support slightly higher prices.

The clearly standout day will be **Tuesday**. The average is forecast at 9.7 Â¢ and the maximum at 25.6 Â¢, the weekâ€™s highest hourly price. Risks will cluster in the late afternoon and early evening, especially 17:00â€“19:00. Behind this is a very low wind minimum (623 MW), which explains the high intraday maximum.

Midweek, the price level will remain elevated. **Wednesdayâ€™s** average would be 9.5 Â¢, with singleâ€‘hour peaks most likely in the morning at 07:00â€“09:00 (daily max 17.7 Â¢) and, more mildly, in the afternoon. **Thursdayâ€™s** average would ease to 5.1 Â¢, though morning hours at 07:00â€“09:00 are still expected to host the dayâ€™s intraday highs; the overall level will stay moderate compared with Tuesday and Wednesday.

At weekâ€™s end, **Fridayâ€™s** average would rise to 9.9 Â¢, the highest average of the week. The daily maximum of 18.8 Â¢ will likely occur in the morning at 08:00â€“10:00, with another accent in the evening at 17:00â€“19:00. Windâ€™s minimum output will remain low, supporting intraday volatility. This is a forecast, so realized prices may still shift, especially if wind production deviates from expectations.
