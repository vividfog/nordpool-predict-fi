Prices are expected to stay mostly low through the week. On most days, average prices will sit around 2–3 cents. Exceptions arise as **Monday** averages 6,8 cents and a single intraday peak appears on **Tuesday**. Wind generation above 3,000 MW on several days will support the low price level.

Monday’s priciest hours will fall into the daytime and evening. The high will reach 10,7 cents, with extended periods holding between 8–10 cents. In the late night and early morning, prices will move around 3–5 cents, but daytime will add clear upward pressure.

On Tuesday the spike risk will stand out in the morning, around 08–10, when the day’s peak is forecast at 18,4 ¢. At the same time, wind output will dip to 1657 MW, which clearly explains the higher intraday maximum. For the rest of the day, prices will mostly stay between 2–8 cents and the daily average will land at 4,8 cents.

The lowest-priced stretches will cluster in the middle and latter part of the week. **Wednesday** is expected to average 2,0 ¢, with nighttime dipping to 0,3–1 ¢. **Thursday** and **Friday** will average around 3 cents. **Saturday** will likely set the weekly low in the small hours, around 01–03, when prices touch 0,1–0,5 cents. **Sunday** will remain steady between 0,3 and 4,2 cents.
