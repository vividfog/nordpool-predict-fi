Electricity prices will fluctuate significantly in the upcoming week. **Friday** sees the average price rise to 11.5 cents per kilowatt-hour, making it the most expensive day of the week. This is partly explained by relatively low wind power production. Prices are cheaper on **Saturday** and **Sunday**, with the average price around 3-4 cents, but there is a risk of price spikes in the evenings when wind power production is lower.

**Monday** sees a slight increase in price compared to the previous days, remaining at a reasonable level with an average of 5.6 cents. Price spikes are also expected during individual hours. **Tuesday** sees the average price drop again to 4.4 cents, but the risk of price spikes remains.

Prices rise again on **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, with **Thursday** having one of the highest average prices of the week at 8.7 cents. Higher maximum prices are expected on these days, particularly on **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, when wind power production is at a lower level.
