In the upcoming week, the electricity price trend is expected to be variable, with **Thursday** standing out as the most expensive day, with an average price of 15.1 ¢/kWh. The maximum price for this day rises to 29.2 ¢/kWh, partly explained by a low wind power minimum production of just 363 MW. This combination may increase the risk of price spikes, particularly during the afternoon and evening hours.

**Friday's** average price drops significantly from Thursday, at 9.4 ¢/kWh. Although wind power production is generally higher than on Thursday, the risk of price spikes remains on individual hours. On Saturday and Sunday, lower prices are expected, with average prices at 3.5 ¢ and 3.3 ¢/kWh. On these days, wind power production is forecasted to be higher, contributing to the lower price level.

Next **Monday**, the average price rises again to 7.0 ¢/kWh, and Tuesday remains at a similar level with 7.1 ¢/kWh. On these days, wind power production is at a lower level, which could explain the increase in prices. The week concludes with **Wednesday**, where prices are expected to fall again to 4.3 ¢/kWh.
