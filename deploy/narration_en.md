*The electricity price forecast for next week reveals the most affordable and expensive periods, as wind power production fluctuates and the risk of price spikes is especially highlighted on Thursday and Friday.*

The Loviisa 1 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance. Its nominal capacity is 496.0 MW, but the available power is currently 0 MW. The maintenance began on 6.9.2025 at 10:00 and is expected to end on 29.9.2025 at 12:00. The maintenance may affect the accuracy of the forecast because training data from maintenance periods is limited.

The week's price forecast shows clear differences between the days. **Saturday** and **Sunday** are expected to be the most affordable days, with the average electricity price staying well below two cents. **Monday** sees a slight price increase but remains moderate. Prices continue to rise on **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, with **Wednesday** in particular forecasted to have slightly higher average prices.

**Thursday** and **Friday** show a clear upward trend in prices, standing out as the most expensive days next week. There is also a high risk of price spikes on **Thursday** and **Friday**, especially during the afternoon and early evening. **Thursday's** highest price is expected to reach 16.8 cents, and **Friday's** 16.2 cents. Wind power production is generally normal, but on **Friday**, low minimum wind power production combined with a high maximum price may explain the higher price expectations.

**Friday** particularly stands out in the week's price development, with the highest expected average price and the risk of price spikes. As the weekend begins, the decline in wind power production partly explains the rise in electricity prices.
