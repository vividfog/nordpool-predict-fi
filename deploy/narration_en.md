The start of the week will be inexpensive. **Thursday** and **Friday** will see average prices stay below three cents, which is explained by strong winds. **Saturday** will remain low and briefly dip below zero during the late-night and morning hours. **Sunday** will edge up to around three cents on average. The cheapest day is expected to be Friday, avg 0.9 ¢.

Early next week the price level will rise. **Monday** will climb to an average of 6.6 ¢. **Tuesday** and **Wednesday** will feature clearly higher peaks, and there will be an elevated risk of hourly price spikes. Tuesday’s maximum of 15.5 ¢ will most likely fall around 09:00–11:00. Tuesday’s minimum wind output (around 1,500 MW) will be very low, which explains the high maximum price. Wednesday is a public holiday, which may reduce demand, but weak wind will keep prices elevated: the week’s highest average price, 9.4 ¢, will land on Wednesday, and the day’s peak of 15.4 ¢ will likely occur around 16:00–18:00.
