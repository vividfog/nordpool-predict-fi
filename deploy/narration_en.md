In the coming week, electricity markets appear quite varied. **Sunday** stands out with the highest maximum price of 7.4 cents, although the daily average remains at three cents. This is partly due to low wind power production during morning and evening hours, increasing the risk of price spikes. **Monday** also presents price fluctuations, but the average price remains affordable at 3.3 cents. Prices might rise particularly in the morning when wind power production is lower.

On **Tuesday**, the lowest prices of the week are expected, with the average price dropping to one cent. This is explained by ample wind power production, which pushes prices downward. In the middle of the week, **Wednesday** sees a slight rise in prices, and the maximum price might exceed six cents. This could be due to variations in wind power production throughout the day.

**Thursday** and **Friday** bring slight differences in prices but remain at an affordable level. Thursday's average price is 2.8 cents, and Friday's is 2.6 cents. As the weekend begins on **Saturday**, prices remain low, with a maximum price reaching only three cents. This suggests that the weekend offers affordable electricity usage opportunities as wind power production remains stable.
