During the coming week, electricity spot prices in Finland will mostly stay at low levels. Daily average prices will range from negative levels on Sunday up to around two cents per kilowatt-hour on Wednesday. However, considerable intraday price fluctuations are expected, so electricity consumers should monitor developments throughout each day.

On **Sunday**, electricity prices will reach the week's lowest levels. The day's average price will be -0.7 cents per kilowatt-hour, with prices fluctuating between -2.0 and 0.2 cents during the day. Negative prices will persist continuously from early morning until late evening, and prices will hit the week's lowest point of -2.0 cents between 13:00 and 14:00.

The week's highest prices will occur on **Wednesday**, when the day's average will be around 2.1 cents. On Wednesday, prices will vary between 0.4 and 4.4 cents, with the day's peak price expected in the morning hours between 08:00 and 10:00. During these hours, prices will clearly exceed levels seen on other days. On **Monday**, prices will also peak high, reaching 4.3 cents between 21:00 and 23:00, though the day's average price will remain significantly lower, at around 0.7 cents.

On the other days of the week, average electricity prices will move between approximately one and one-and-a-half cents. Intraday price fluctuations will be moderate, although individual risks of price spikes exist on **Tuesday**, **Thursday**, and **Friday**. On these days, high-price periods typically occur during morning or evening hours, when consumption usually peaks.

Wind power production will vary during the week. On Saturday, wind power generation will remain low, averaging only 632 MW, while on Monday, wind power will be at a normal level, around 2660 MW. Throughout the week, variations in wind generation partly explain fluctuations in electricity prices, especially Wednesday's higher price level, as wind production will stay relatively low, averaging around 1765 MW.
