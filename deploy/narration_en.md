Electricity prices for the upcoming week will generally remain moderate. The average price level will stay below four cents throughout the entire week, indicating a relatively affordable period for electricity users. However, daily price variations will be significant, with evening hours occasionally showing notably higher prices.

The lowest-priced day of the week will be **Saturday**, when the average price will be just 0.3 cents, and the minimum price will even drop into negative territory, at -1.2 cents. This practically means that on Saturday between approximately 16:00 and 18:00, electricity prices will be exceptionally low.

The highest peak prices of the week will occur on **Monday** and **Wednesday**. Monday's highest hourly price, nearly 10 cents, is expected in the evening between 19:00 and 21:00. Wednesday's peak price of 9.2 cents will fall in the morning hours, between 07:00 and 09:00. On these days, there is a risk of price spikes, and actual prices may rise even higher than forecasted.

The average price on **Tuesday**, around two cents, will remain moderate, and no significant price fluctuations are expected throughout the day. On **Thursday** and **Friday**, electricity prices will be slightly higher but still reasonable, averaging around 3 to 4 cents. Thursday's maximum price of 6.5 cents will be reached in the morning, between 09:00 and 11:00. Friday's maximum price of 8.3 cents will occur in the morning between 08:00 and 10:00.

The week will conclude on **Sunday** again with a lower price level, averaging around one cent. However, the most expensive moment of the day will be in the evening between 17:00 and 19:00, when the price rises slightly above three cents.
