The weekend will open on **Saturday** at a fairly low level: an average price of 3.7 ¢ (daily range 2.3–11.5 ¢). On **Sunday** it will rise to 5.1 ¢, and individual hours will carry spike risk, leaning toward 18:00–20:00. Early in the week prices will tighten: on **Monday** the average will be 9.9 ¢ and peaks will fall around 08:00–10:00. On **Tuesday** the average will climb to 13.5 ¢ and the maximum of 20.7 ¢ will occur around 16:00–18:00; the morning 08:00–10:00 will also be elevated. On **Wednesday** it will stand out as the priciest day: an average of 14.6 ¢ and a peak at 22.8 ¢ around 08:00–10:00. On **Thursday** the average will ease to 7.2 ¢, but a morning spike risk is expected around 08:00–10:00. The week will end on **Friday**, when the average will remain at 2.3 ¢ and variability will stay modest.

The price path will be driven by wind power variability. The cheapest days will coincide with strong winds, while early in the week winds will be weak. On Tuesday the minimum wind output will drop to 649 MW and on Wednesday to 980 MW, which explains the markedly higher peak prices of 20.7–22.8 ¢. On Thursday the wind will strengthen, which will show as a normalization of the average price.
