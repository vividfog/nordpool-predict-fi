In the electricity market price forecasts for the week, clear variations can be observed. **Wednesday** stands out with the highest average price at 9.8 cents per kilowatt-hour. The risk of price spikes on Wednesday is high, especially during the morning and evening hours. On other days, prices remain at lower levels, and wind power production is generally at a low level, influencing price trends.

**Thursday** and **Friday** offer moderate average prices of 6.7 and 4.1 cents, respectively. On these days, wind power production is significantly higher, helping to keep prices in check. Over the weekend, on **Saturday** and **Sunday**, the average prices are at their lowest, 2.7 and 2.9 cents. This is partly due to abundant wind power, further lowering prices.

Next **Monday** and **Tuesday**, prices return to more moderate levels, with average prices at 4.8 and 4.4 cents. On Monday, wind power production is again high, which helps to keep prices low. Throughout the week, the temperature remains above 15 degrees, which does not significantly affect electricity prices.
