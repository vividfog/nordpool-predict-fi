|:-------------|:----------------:|:----------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| **Monday** | 10,7 | 1,9 - 18,6 | 800 - 2458 | 3,1 |
| **Tuesday** | 8,6 | 2,0 - 19,7 | 890 - 4870 | 1,2 |
| **Wednesday** | 2,7 | 0,9 - 4,3 | 2910 - 6081 | 1,4 |
| **Thursday** | 2,3 | 0,0 - 4,8 | 3338 - 4608 | 1,4 |
| **Friday** | 2,0 | -0,7 - 4,6 | 3333 - 5426 | 2,2 |
| **Saturday** | 2,2 | 0,5 - 4,0 | 3562 - 4731 | 1,1 |
| **Sunday** | 2,2 | -0,1 - 4,1 | 3077 - 4930 | 0,7 |

The start of the week is expected to be clearly pricier than the latter part. **Monday** will average 10,7 ¢, and a high spike risk is signaled for individual hours, likely between 17–19 (peak 18,6 ¢). **Tuesday** will ease to 8,6 ¢ on average, but the day’s maximum is forecast to be the week’s highest at 19,7 ¢. Morning peaks around 8–10 are explained by the low wind‑power minimum (890 MW), which underpins the highest max. Monday’s wind will also be weak (min 800 MW), adding volatility and supporting spike risk.

From **Wednesday** onward, prices will settle at low levels: Wednesday’s average will be 2,7 ¢ and from **Thursday** to **Sunday** 2,0–2,3 ¢. Abundant wind power from Wednesday onward will keep prices largely under four cents. The cheapest moments of the week fall at night: **Friday** 1–3 and **Sunday** 2–4, when prices dip briefly negative (–0,7 ¢ and –0,1 ¢). Daytime will stay mostly in the 2–5 ¢ range.
