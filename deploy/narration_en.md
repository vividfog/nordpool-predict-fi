Weekly prices will vary clearly: the early week will be on the pricier side, while the weekend will get cheaper. **Tuesday** stands out most, with the average reaching 13,9 cents and a daily peak at 22,5 ¢; this is explained by a very low minimum wind output (253 MW). The spike risk on Tuesday will cluster around 08–10 and 17–19. On **Wednesday** the spike risk will also emphasize the morning, around 08–10. On **Thursday** a possible spike will fall around 15–17, and on **Friday** the evening high around 18–20. On **Saturday** the spike risk will be more moderate and centered on 08–10.

The cheapest day will be **Sunday**, with the average at 3,8 cents and the day’s top at only 6,2 ¢. Low prices on Sunday and next **Monday** will be explained by strong winds, lifting average production above 3,000 MW. Overall the week will show a clear arc: from Tuesday to Friday prices will stay on the higher side (avg 9,9–13,9 ¢), after which Sunday pulls the level below four cents and Monday returns closer to mid-range.
