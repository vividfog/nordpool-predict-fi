| **Thursday** | 1,0 | 0,2 - 2,5 | 2053 - 6485 | 1,1 |
| **Friday** | 0,6 | -0,5 - 1,4 | 5677 - 7126 | 2,1 |

The latter part of the week is projected to be very low-cost. On **Thursday** the average price is expected to dip to 1,0 cents and stay between 0,2–2,5 ¢. Strong wind power will support the low level. **Friday’s** average price is expected to settle at 0,6 cents, and negative prices will appear in the small hours (lowest −0,5 ¢) thanks to abundant wind. On **Saturday** the price level is expected to rise slightly, avg 2,2 ¢ with a range of −0,1–5,4 ¢. **Sunday** will still remain under four cents: avg 3,3 ¢ and a 2,0–4,3 ¢ range. The affordability of these days will be explained by wind power consistently above 3,000 MW.

A shift is expected next **Monday**, when the average price is projected to climb to 10,0 ¢ and the day’s peak to 17,1 ¢. The risk of price spikes for individual hours will be high especially between 17:00–19:00, as wind power minimum output falls to 873 MW; this explains the unusually high peak. Next **Tuesday** the average will be 9,2 ¢ and the high 15,1 ¢, with a pronounced period in the morning from 07:00–09:00 under weak winds. Next **Wednesday** is a public holiday; demand is expected to be lower than normal, and the 4,4–11,4 ¢ range is projected to be more moderate than Monday and Tuesday (avg 7,3 ¢).
