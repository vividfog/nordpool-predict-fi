For the remainder of the week, the price level will largely settle around 8–10 cents. On **Wednesday**, the week’s highest maximum is expected at 15.3 ¢, and there will be a high risk of price spikes in individual hours. In the hourly forecast, the peak will fall in the evening, roughly between 19:00 and 21:00. **Thursday** is a public holiday, and demand is expected to be lower than normal, which may push the price down. Thursday will also carry a risk of price spikes in individual hours, and the highest level will again concentrate in the evening, roughly between 19:00 and 21:00. Later in the week, the average temperature will drop below -5°C from Thursday to Sunday.
