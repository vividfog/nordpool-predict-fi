The beginning of the week will bring significant fluctuations in electricity prices, particularly on **Monday** and **Tuesday**, with a high risk of price spikes. **Monday** stands out with a high average price of 14.6 ¬¢/kWh and a maximum price of 28.4 ¬¢/kWh. The high price combined with the lowest wind power production increases the risk of price peaks, especially in the morning and evening hours.

**Tuesday** sees a drop in average electricity price to 9.1 ¬¢/kWh, but the maximum price may rise to 23.1 ¬¢/kWh. This day is also prone to price spikes, which may occur in the afternoon or evening hours. Wind power production on Tuesday is significantly higher than on **Monday**, which may help stabilize price fluctuations.

**Wednesday** is expected to be the cheapest day of the week with an average price of 5.8 ¬¢/kWh. Although there is a risk of price spikes, it is smaller than at the beginning of the week. Wind power production is near its peak on Wednesday, which may help curb price increases.

**Thursday** sees prices rise slightly from Wednesday, with an average price of 6.9 ¬¢/kWh. Wind power production remains at a reasonable level, but individual price spikes may occur, especially in the afternoon hours. **Friday** and **Saturday** bring the lowest prices, thanks to strong wind power production. On these days, prices remain on average below three cents.

The week ends with **Sunday**, when prices are expected to rise again. The average price is 6.0 ¬¢/kWh, but the maximum price may rise to 18.1 ¬¢/kWh, which could mean price spikes, especially in the evening.
