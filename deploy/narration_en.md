The week will look inexpensive overall: on most days the average price will stay under four cents. However, **Monday’s** pricing will stand out clearly. The average is projected at 7,8 ¢ and the daily top will rise to nearly 19,7 ¢. The most expensive hours will cluster in the morning at 08:00–10:00 and early evening at 17:00–19:00. The higher maximum will be explained by a low minimum in wind output, dipping to 1959 MW.

The cheapest stretch will fall in the middle of the week. **Tuesday’s** average will hold at 2,8 ¢, and **Wednesday** will go lower still, averaging 0,5 ¢. **Thursday’s** day-level average will be 2,0 ¢. On these days wind power will be abundant, pushing prices down; the lowest levels will occur in the early hours on Wednesday around 03:00–05:00 slightly below zero (down to -0,5 ¢) and at the start of Thursday 00:00–02:00 (-0,4 ¢).

The week’s higher evening hours will be seen on **Friday**, when the priciest window will land at 18:00–20:00 near ten cents (day’s maximum 9,7 ¢). Even so, the daily average will remain 3,3 ¢. Prices will stay fairly flat on **Saturday** within a 1,8–4,7 ¢ range, with a 3,1 ¢ average.

At the end of the week on **Sunday**, the price level will again be low and even. The average is projected at 1,8 ¢ and the upper bound at 3,5 ¢. Wind supply will be plentiful, supporting these figures without clear intra-day swings.
