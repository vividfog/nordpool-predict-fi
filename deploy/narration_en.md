The start of the week will be clearly the most expensive period of the week. **On Tuesday**, the average price is expected to rise to 16.6 cents, and the day’s highest hourly price reaches 24.2 cents in the forecast. This aligns with wind power’s minimum output dropping unusually low during the day, to 522 MW. **On Monday**, the average price will sit at 16.2 cents, and the forecast maximum is 23.6 cents. The risk of price spikes will be high on both days in individual hours, and the most expensive hours will fall in the forecast in the evening, around 17:00–21:00.

From Wednesday onward, the price level will ease. **On Friday**, the average price is expected to be 11.6 cents, and as the weekend approaches, prices will fall further. **On Saturday**, the average price will remain at 8.6 cents, and the day’s highest price will stay at 11.0 cents. **On Sunday**, the average price will hold at 9.0 cents, with a range of 6.4–11.4 cents. Later in the week, wind power is forecast to be plentiful, and this will show especially in the more moderate prices on Friday and over the weekend.
