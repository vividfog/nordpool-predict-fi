*Electricity price forecasts show significant variations for the upcoming week, with clear spike risks on Tuesday and next Monday, while Wednesday offers more affordable prices aided by strong winds.*

The Loviisa 2 nuclear power plant is undergoing maintenance, which began on 17.8.2025 at 04:00 and is expected to conclude on 8.9.2025 at 00:00. This maintenance may affect the accuracy of the electricity price forecast, as there is limited training data available for periods of maintenance.

The forecast was updated on Monday at 03:47.

The week's electricity market price forecast shows clear variations between different days. **Tuesday** stands out with the highest maximum price of 20.9 ¬¢/kWh, particularly during afternoon and early evening hours when wind power production drops below 1000 MW. This significantly increases the risk of price spikes. **Wednesday**, on the other hand, is expected to have a more affordable price level, with the day's average price around 4.3 ¬¢, the lowest of the week. This is partly due to high wind power production exceeding 3000 MW.

**Thursday** and **Friday** bring moderate price fluctuations, especially during afternoon and evening hours, when prices may rise significantly above average. **Saturday** and **Sunday** are expected to maintain moderate price levels, although price spikes might occur, particularly in the evening.

Next **Monday's** price forecast shows higher figures, partly due to low wind power production and possibly because of nuclear plant maintenance. The average price for this day is 11.9 ¬¢/kWh, the highest of the week.
