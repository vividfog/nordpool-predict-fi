The upcoming week brings varying electricity prices, with average prices remaining mostly low. **Friday** stands out with a higher average price forecasted at 2.2 ¢/kWh. According to the forecast, there is also a risk of price spikes on Friday, particularly during evening hours when the maximum price could rise to 6.1 ¢/kWh. This may be due to the low wind power production, predicted to be only 783-2507 MW for the day.

**Saturday** and **Sunday** appear to be cheaper, with average prices at 1.1 ¢/kWh and 1.0 ¢/kWh, respectively. However, they may experience price spikes during individual hours. On Sunday, wind power production varies between 927 MW and 2876 MW, potentially affecting price fluctuations throughout the day.

**Tuesday** is forecasted to be the cheapest day of the week, with the average price possibly dropping to as low as -0.1 ¢/kWh. This is partly due to strong wind power, which is expected to average 2513 MW, helping to keep prices low. No price spikes are expected on Tuesday.

**Monday** and **Wednesday** are forecasted to be reasonably priced, although Monday carries a risk of price spikes. Monday's average price is 1.7 ¢/kWh, and Wednesday's is 1.3 ¢/kWh. On both days, wind power production remains at an average level, contributing to moderate prices.
