The highest hourly prices will fall on both days in the early evening, roughly between 16:00 and 18:00. The forecast also includes a high risk of isolated price spikes on these days.

On **Thursday**, the average price will drop to 13.7 cents, and the range will narrow to 9.6–16.3 cents. Thursday is also marked as having a high risk of isolated spikes. On **Friday**, the average will slip to 12.2 cents, and the lowest average of the week is forecast for **Saturday**, at 10.4 cents. On **Sunday**, the level will remain close to that, before rising again next Monday to 13.4 cents, and the spike risk is expected to be high once more.
