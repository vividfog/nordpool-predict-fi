In the coming week, electricity price trends will be variable. On **Monday**, prices are expected to remain reasonable, with an average price of 3.7 ¬¢/kWh.

**Tuesday** is forecasted to have significant price spikes, with the highest prices potentially rising up to 14.7 cents. This is partly due to low wind power production in the morning. The average price rises to 7.3 ¬¢/kWh, making Tuesday one of the most expensive days of the week.

On **Wednesday**, electricity price expectations remain high, with the average price staying at 9.1 ¬¢/kWh. Prices may peak at 18.8 cents in the morning hours, due to low wind power production.

Towards the end of the week, prices are expected to decrease. **Thursday** and **Friday** average prices will settle between 6-7 cents, whereas on **Saturday** and **Sunday**, prices will significantly drop, with Sunday's average price being only 2.5 ¬¢/kWh. The weekend is expected to have abundant wind power, partially explaining the lower prices.
