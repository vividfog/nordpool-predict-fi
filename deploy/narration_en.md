| **Wednesday**  | 5.3 | 1.3 - 12.7 | 840 - 3298 | 12.9 |
| **Thursday**  | 5.4 | 1.2 - 13.1 | 1102 - 1847 | 12.7 |
| **Friday**  | 4.9 | 0.8 - 11.4 | 1722 - 2862 | 11.8 |
| **Saturday**  | 3.2 | 1.0 - 5.8 | 1889 - 3860 | 10.8 |
| **Sunday**  | 1.0 | -0.3 - 2.8 | 1997 - 4620 | 10.8 |
| **Monday**  | 3.0 | 0.4 - 6.5 | 2983 - 4815 | 10.1 |
| **Tuesday**  | 6.9 | 0.3 - 21.8 | 1318 - 4113 | 9.3 |

Forecasts for the upcoming week indicate that **Tuesday** stands out with a high average price of 6.9¬¢. The maximum price of the day could rise to as much as 21.8¬¢, which is significantly higher than other days. This may be due to the minimum wind power production, which is well below 2000 MW. This, combined with the high maximum price, suggests significant price fluctuations during the day.

**Wednesday** and **Thursday** are also expected to experience price spikes during individual hours, but their average prices are close to each other, around 5.3-5.4¬¢. Price variation is significant, and according to the forecast, the highest prices typically occur in the evening.

Weekend days are forecasted to be more affordable. **Sunday** is the least expensive day of the week, with an average price potentially dropping to 1.0¬¢. Prices remain moderate on **Monday**, with an average price forecasted at 3.0¬¢. Strong wind power over the weekend may partly explain the low prices, as wind power production on Sunday reaches a peak of 4620 MW.

Finally, **Friday**'s average price is set at 4.9¬¢, and while there is price variation, it is more moderate than on Tuesday. According to the forecasts, Friday's highest price may occur in the evening, but it does not reach Tuesday's level.
