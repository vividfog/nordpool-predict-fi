Price levels will remain mostly reasonable. **Saturday** will carry a risk of single-hour spikes, likely in the morning around 07–09. Minimum wind output will dip very low (below 1000 MW) then, which may lift peak-hour prices relative to the rest of the day. **Sunday** will stay low throughout, supported by abundant wind generation. The week’s most expensive day will be **Wednesday**, with an average of 8,5 ¢ and a projected maximum of 12,6 ¢.

The week will start off fairly inexpensive: **Monday’s** average will sit a bit above four cents. **Tuesday’s** and Wednesday’s higher levels will cluster in the busier hours; on Tuesday the highs will land in the afternoon around 16–18, and on Wednesday around 08–10. **Thursday** and **Friday** will track near the weekly mean without major swings. The cheapest hours will appear overnight and through Sunday morning, at times dipping below two cents.
