The upcoming week shows quite a variation in spot electricity prices. **Friday** is one of the more affordable days, with an average price of 4.2 cents per kilowatt-hour, although it carries risks of price spikes, especially during evening hours such as 18:00-20:00. **Sunday**, on the other hand, stands out with the lowest average price of 2.9 cents per kilowatt-hour, even though price spikes may occur during individual hours.

At the beginning of the week, **Monday** and **Tuesday**, prices rise slightly but remain below five cents. Wind power production is moderate during these days, but price spikes may occur in the evening on Monday, between 17:00-19:00.

Towards the end of the week, **Wednesday** and **Thursday** see higher prices. Wednesday's average price rises to 5.8 cents per kilowatt-hour, with significant intra-day variations, particularly during evening hours. Thursday follows closely with an average price of 5.7 cents.

Overall, next week's price development offers consumers both inexpensive and more costly times. Price fluctuations are partly due to variations in wind power production, especially on days with lower output.
