In the coming week, electricity prices are expected to vary moderately, with both affordable and slightly more expensive days in sight. **Tuesday** appears to be one of the most affordable days of the week, with an average price of 1.3 ¬¢/kWh. The lowest price of the day is even negative, which is typical for nighttime hours. **Wednesday** sees a slight increase in expected prices, and price spikes may occur during certain hours, especially in the morning and evening.

**Thursday** stands out as the most expensive day in the forecast, with the average price rising to 4.7 ¬¢/kWh. Variations in wind power production during the day may affect maximum prices, and there is a risk of price spikes. **Friday** continues along the same lines as Thursday with a slightly lower average price, but the risk of price spikes remains. Wind power production is at a low level during this time, which may contribute to higher prices.

The weekend brings more affordable prices. **Saturday** sees the average price drop to 2.1 ¬¢/kWh, and on Sunday, it is even lower at 0.4 ¬¢/kWh. Although Sunday's prices are low, the risk of price spikes remains, while **Monday** sees the price level rise again to 4.4 ¬¢/kWh. Higher prices may still occur during certain hours.
