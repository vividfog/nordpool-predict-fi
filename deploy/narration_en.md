*Next week, electricity prices are expected to fluctuate significantly, with Wednesday anticipated to bring the highest price spikes. On other days, prices remain moderate, partly due to strong wind power production.*

Loviisa 2 began its maintenance outage on August 17, 2025, at 04:00 and is predicted to end on September 13, 2025, at 00:00.

The upcoming week brings significant variations in electricity prices. **Wednesday** is predicted to have the highest prices of the week, with an expected average price of 6.5 Â¢/kWh. The maximum price on that day could rise to 15.2 Â¢/kWh, increasing the risk of price spikes particularly in the late morning, around 9-11 AM. This may be due to low wind power production combined with higher demand peaks.

**Thursday** and **Friday** are expected to have significantly cheaper prices, with average prices at 0.5 Â¢ and 0.8 Â¢/kWh. Thursday stands out particularly due to strong wind power production, explaining the low price level. A similar trend continues into **Saturday**, when the average price drops again to the 0.5 Â¢/kWh level.

**Sunday** sees a return of the risk of price spikes, although the day's average price remains moderate at 0.7 Â¢/kWh. Prices could rise momentarily on Sunday evening, especially between 7-9 PM, so consumers should be alert.

Next **Monday**, prices might increase slightly from the weekend levels, with the average price at 1.1 Â¢/kWh. **Tuesday** is expected to see prices drop again, with an average price of 0.6 Â¢/kWh. In the overall picture of the week, Wednesday's price spikes stand out, while on other days, prices remain relatively low.
