In the coming days, electricity market price expectations show clear differences. **Friday's** price expectations are relatively low, with an average price of 3.0 ¬¢/kWh. During this time, wind power production is at a moderate level, which helps keep prices modest. **Saturday** and **Sunday** see even lower price levels, with Sunday's average price dropping to just 1.1 ¬¢/kWh. Over the weekend, stronger wind power combined with mild weather supports low prices.

**Tuesday's** forecasted price rises significantly, with the day's average reaching 12.5 ¬¢. Wind power production decreases considerably, which raises the price level. In particular, Tuesday is expected to see price spikes, with peaks likely occurring during morning and evening hours. **Wednesday's** price expectations remain high, with an average price of 13.8 ¬¢. Wind power production is also lower on Wednesday, which may explain the higher price levels.

**Thursday's** price expectations decrease slightly, but the average price remains at 9.1 ¬¢. Although wind power production is somewhat higher than earlier in the week, the risk of price spikes still exists.

Overall, the beginning of the week brings significant price fluctuations, especially for Tuesday and Wednesday. The weekend, on the other hand, offers more affordable prices, which is good news for electricity consumers.
