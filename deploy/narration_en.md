In the coming week, significant fluctuations in electricity prices are expected, especially on **Tuesday**, when the day's average price is projected to be 12 cents. The highest prices on Tuesday are expected in the evening, potentially exceeding 22 cents due to low wind power production, which may drive the maximum price higher.

On **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, price spikes may occur, particularly in the morning and evening hours. Wednesday's average price is set at 9.2 cents, while Thursday is expected to have an average price of 8.1 cents, with both days having a high risk of price spikes. **Friday** sees a decrease in the average price to 5.2 cents, but the risk of price spikes remains.

During the weekend, prices are low, with **Saturday** having an average price of 2.5 cents and **Sunday** at 2.4 cents, with a minimal risk of price spikes as wind power production is at a high level. Next **Monday**, prices remain low with an average price of 2.8 cents.
