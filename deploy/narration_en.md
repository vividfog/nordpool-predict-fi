Moderate prices will be expected at the end of the week: the average price on **Friday** will be 5,3 ¢ and on **Saturday** 3,5 ¢, which is explained by strong wind. From **Sunday** to **Thursday** the price level will be expected to rise due to weak wind. The week’s highest average price will be seen on **Wednesday** (13,8 ¢), and the week’s top hourly price will be forecast to reach 20,4 ¢. At that time, minimum wind output will drop very low (below 1000 MW), which explains the elevated peak. The cheapest hours will likely fall in the small hours of Friday, when prices dip below one cent (0,4–0,6 ¢).

Spike risk will be assessed as elevated on **Sunday**, **Tuesday**, **Wednesday** and **Thursday**. On Sunday, potential peaks will likely occur at 17:00–19:00. On Tuesday, spikes will be expected at 17:00–19:00. On Wednesday, a peak will appear in the morning at 8:00–10:00, when single hours can rise above 20 ¢. On Thursday, the spike-risk window will be 16:00–18:00. No similar phenomenon will be anticipated for Saturday and Monday.
