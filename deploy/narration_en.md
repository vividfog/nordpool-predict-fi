*Next week's electricity price forecasts remain generally reasonable, with the weekend offering particularly affordable rates. Wind power production helps keep prices low as average temperatures remain cool.*

There is an ongoing maintenance outage at the Loviisa nuclear power plant's Unit 1, which began on September 6th at 10 a.m. and is expected to end on October 3rd at 6 p.m. This maintenance outage may impact the accuracy of the electricity price forecast, as there is limited training data available for such periods.
