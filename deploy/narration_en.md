The week’s price trend will be twofold. The lowest average prices will be seen over the weekend: on Saturday and Sunday pricing is expected to stay around five cents. At the beginning and end of the week, prices will mostly move in the 6–9 cent range. The most distinct day will be Friday, with the average at 12,0 ¢ and a forecast peak at 21,8 ¢. Friday’s minimum wind output will drop very low (526 MW), which explains the peak, expected to land in the evening at 17:00–19:00. The week’s cheapest moment will occur early Sunday night at 00:00–02:00, when the price will dip below three cents.

As a public holiday, Saturday will reduce demand, so the price will remain low, but a spike risk is noted for single hours; the emphasis would fall in the late morning at 10:00–12:00. Single spikes are also anticipated next Monday (highest hours at 15:00–17:00 and 17:00–19:00), next Tuesday (10:00–12:00) and next Wednesday (17:00–19:00). Tuesday’s average (10,5 ¢) will be expensive, aligning with weak wind. On Thursday and Sunday, price variation will remain moderate with no spike risks.
