| **Tuesday** | 0.4 | 0.1 - 1.0 | 2889 - 6187 | 5.0 |
| **Wednesday** | 0.7 | -0.6 - 1.9 | 3975 - 5502 | 6.9 |
| **Thursday** | 4.3 | 0.0 - 9.8 | 1694 - 4224 | 7.1 |
| **Friday** | 4.8 | 1.1 - 11.3 | 1101 - 3364 | 6.6 |
| **Saturday** | 3.7 | 1.0 - 7.1 | 2221 - 3112 | 6.4 |
| **Sunday** | 3.9 | 1.1 - 7.8 | 979 - 3598 | 5.4 |
| **Monday** | 10.8 | 4.0 - 19.6 | 807 - 1703 | 3.1 |

The week will start at low levels. **Tuesday’s** average price is projected at 0.4 ¢. **Wednesday’s** level will remain low (avg 0.7 ¢), and negative prices will occur at night, down to −0.6 ¢. Abundant wind power from Tuesday to Thursday will explain the low prices; **Thursday’s** average rises to 4.3 ¢, yet stays below five cents.

Attention will shift to the end of the week. **Friday’s** maximum of 11.3 ¢ will occur in the morning at 08:00–10:00, and the risk of a single spike will stand out because the wind-power minimum falls to about 1,100 MW. **Sunday** is a public holiday, which may reduce demand; still, the morning at 07:00–09:00 could climb to around 7.8 ¢. Next **Monday** will stand out with a clearly higher level: the average rises to 10.8 ¢ and the peak reaches 19.6 ¢ in the early evening at 17:00–19:00. A very low wind-power minimum, around 800 MW, partly explains this spike risk.
