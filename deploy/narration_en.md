The week will split in two: the early-week price level will be clearly higher, and later in the week prices will drop for long stretches to below four cents. The clearly most expensive day will be **Tuesday**, with an average price of 17,8 ¢ and a daily peak hour at 30,4 ¢. Behind this is very weak wind: the day’s average wind output will stay at 899 MW and the low is projected at just 470 MW, which also explains the strong intra-day price swings.

High spike-risk days will fall on **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**. On Tuesday, peaks will cluster into two windows: 09–11 and 19–21. On **Wednesday**, the risk will be concentrated in the morning, 08–10, when the hourly price is forecast to touch 24,6 ¢. Wednesday’s average, 11,1 ¢, will sit on the elevated early-week level, and wind will again be clearly weaker than usual (average 1412 MW, minimum 550 MW), supporting higher price expectations.

Later in the week the price curve will flatten. On **Thursday**, the average will drop to 2,3 ¢ and the range will stay unusually narrow (1,6–3,3 ¢). Wind power will be abundant at 3365–4730 MW, supporting the low level. On **Friday**, the average will rise back to a moderate 6,2 ¢, but without notable intra-day swings.

The weekend will remain moderate. On **Saturday**, the average will be 6,9 ¢ and hourly prices will climb in the evening; spike risk will center on 19–21. On **Sunday**, prices will return close to Thursday’s level, with a 2,4 ¢ average and a 1,4–4,6 ¢ range. Wind will strengthen again, supporting low prices.
