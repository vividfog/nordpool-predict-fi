Next week's electricity markets appear to be variable, with prices expected to fluctuate across different days. **Sunday** stands out with the highest average price of 5.0 ¬¢/kWh, and the maximum price could reach up to 17.0 ¬¢. This is partly due to the low wind power production, which is forecasted to be at a minimum of only 466 MW. Such a low wind power production could partly explain the price spikes, which are expected to occur particularly during the afternoon and evening hours. The average wind power production on Sunday is also significantly below the levels of other days.

The cheapest days of the week seem to be **Monday** and **Saturday**, with average prices remaining low at 1.3 ¬¢ and 1.4 ¬¢. On these days, wind power production is strong, which could partly keep prices down. On the other hand, **Wednesday** and **Thursday** bring the possibility of price spikes, even though the average prices for the days are below 5.5 ¬¢. On these days, wind power production is lower, which could raise electricity prices during certain hours.

On Friday, prices average at 2.2 ¬¢, and the minimum price could even drop to negative. Wind power production is at a typical level, which helps stabilize prices towards the end of the week. As the weekend approaches, prices are expected to remain moderate, with no significant fluctuations anticipated.
