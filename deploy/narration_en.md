The week will begin noticeably cheaper and then turn more expensive. On **Friday**, the average price will stay at 4.7 cents, and the day’s lowest hourly price will dip to 1.0 cents. It will be below freezing throughout the period, because the average temperature will remain below -6°C every day. The price level will already rise on **Saturday** to 7.4 cents, and on **Sunday** the average will climb to 10.9 cents.

**Wednesday** will stand out as the most expensive day, with an expected average of 15.8 cents and a daily maximum reaching 23.1 cents. A public holiday will fall on **Tuesday**, and demand may be lower than normal, which could push the price down. A risk of hourly price spikes is expected on **Sunday** and on **Monday**, **Tuesday**, **Wednesday**, and **Thursday**. In the hourly forecast, the highest levels will be concentrated especially in the late morning, for example on **Wednesday** around 08:00–10:00 and on **Thursday** around 16:00–18:00.
