| **Tuesday** | 16,9 | 6,8 - 29,0 | 462 - 1881 | 6,4 |

| **Friday** | 5,6 | 1,8 - 10,4 | 2302 - 4507 | 5,9 |

The week will appear to split in two. **Monday** will see an average price at 7,6 cents with large intraday swings: near zero overnight and in the early morning, then rising to around 20 cents in the evening. High average wind generation will support low night and midday prices.

On **Tuesday** there will be a high risk of price spikes on individual hours. The peak will fall in the late morning around 9–11, with the price rising to 29,0 cents. Another pronounced peak will appear in the evening at 19–21. The day’s minimum wind output will drop to 462 MW, while the week’s highest maximum price will materialize. The low wind minimum explains the higher maximum price.

On **Wednesday** the spike risk will continue, but the level will remain more moderate than Tuesday. The morning peak will fall around 8–10, reaching 23,1 cents. Wind will be weak (avg. 1533 MW), lifting especially morning and afternoon levels above Monday but still clearly below Tuesday.

On **Thursday** price variation will be very small, and the whole day will stay within 1,1–3,3 cents. Strong winds (avg. 4129 MW) will support a steady, low level. Toward the end of the week, **Friday** and **Saturday** averages will settle around 5–6 cents without major intraday deviations, while **Sunday** will again remain within 1,3–4,3 cents.

Within the weekend, **Saturday’s** late evening will stand out, when 19–21 will reach the day’s high of 11,3 cents, and morning and midday hours will stay below 10 cents. On **Friday** the more expensive hours will fall between 8–12, and the day’s low will arrive late in the evening. On **Sunday** the price level will remain low throughout without clear highlights.
