In the upcoming week, electricity price expectations vary significantly between days. **Monday** and **Tuesday** are forecasted to be the most expensive days of the week, with average prices of 8.2¢ and 7.4¢. On these days, there is also a risk of individual price spikes, where prices could rise above 15¢ per hour. Notably, on Monday, price peaks could occur between 8-10 AM.

**Wednesday** brings a significant drop in the average price, predicted to be just 2.0¢. This is partly due to abundant wind power production, peaking at 2639 MW during the day. Despite this, individual price spikes might occur, as wind power minimum production falls below 1000 MW.

Towards the end of the week, prices drop further. **Thursday**, **Friday**, and **Saturday** appear as affordable days, with average prices remaining below one cent. On Saturday in particular, price expectations are at their lowest, with the day's average potentially being negative at -0.4¢. During this time, wind power production is strong, explaining the low prices.

**Sunday** concludes the week with moderate price levels, with an average price of 1.1¢. On Sunday as well, individual price spikes may occur, especially during the afternoon and early evening hours.
