The upcoming week will bring significant fluctuations in electricity prices. **Monday** and **Tuesday** stand out with their higher average and maximum prices, which sometimes exceed 15 cents. On these days, wind power production is relatively low, which, together with high demand, may drive prices up. There is a possibility of price spikes, especially on Monday between 7 PM and 9 PM, when prices may reach up to 17.6 cents.

**On Wednesday**, prices drop significantly, with the day's average price being only 3.0 cents. This is partly due to higher wind power production, balancing the demand. **Thursday** and **Friday** continue this trend, with prices remaining very low, and Thursday even forecasts negative prices. Over the weekend, namely **Saturday** and **Sunday**, prices remain low, but Sunday may see price spikes, particularly in the evening between 7 PM and 9 PM.

Wind power production increases towards the end of the week, partly explaining the lower electricity price levels. The cheapest moments of the week are particularly observed on **Saturday**, when the average price is even negative. This offers consumers the opportunity to take advantage of cheap electricity.
