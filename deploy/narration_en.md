Prices are expected to vary clearly through the week. The lowest average prices will likely be seen on **Thursday** (avg 3,8 ¢) and **Sunday** (avg 4,2 ¢). **Saturday** is a public holiday, which may ease demand and keep prices moderate (avg 5,1 ¢). On **Monday** (avg 7,8 ¢) and **Wednesday** (avg 6,0 ¢) the level will stay mid-range. The week’s most expensive days will be **Tuesday** (avg 10,4 ¢, max 19,8 ¢) and **Friday** (avg 10,0 ¢, max 19,8 ¢). Higher averages on Tuesday and Friday coincide with weaker wind output, while lower prices on Thursday and Sunday are supported by strong wind.

Spike risk will stand out on **Tuesday** and **Friday**. Tuesday’s peak is projected for the morning, around 08:00–10:00, with an exceptionally low wind minimum of just 891 MW helping to explain the higher 19,8 ¢ maximum. On Friday, the spike is expected in the evening, around 17:00–19:00, with a projected 19,8 ¢ maximum. For **Saturday**, a spike risk is flagged for individual hours; the most likely window is around midnight, about 23:00–01:00.
