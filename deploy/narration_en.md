The forecast indicates clear differences in electricity prices throughout the week. On **Saturday** and **Sunday**, market electricity prices are expected to be particularly low, even negative during nighttime, due to abundant wind power supply keeping the prices down. After the weekend, prices rise, with **Monday** anticipated to have the highest average price of the week at 3.9 cents. This might be due to low wind power production.

In the middle of the week, **Wednesday** is predicted to experience high maximum prices reaching over 11 cents, possibly due to fluctuations in wind power production and other factors. **Thursday** forecasts suggest more moderate prices again, as wind power production stabilizes.

The entire week is expected to be cool, but not exceptionally cold. Variations in wind power significantly impact the price trend, particularly reflected in the weekend and early week prices. The lowest prices are expected during the weekend, while at the beginning of the week and on Wednesday, price fluctuations might occur.
