The electricity price expectations for the week show variability. **On Wednesday**, a higher average price of 8.8 ¢/kWh is predicted, with the day's maximum price reaching 23.1 ¢/kWh, partly due to a low wind power minimum production of 836 MW. **On Thursday**, the average price drops to 7.0 ¢/kWh, but the risk of price spikes exists, especially during morning and evening hours. **Friday's** average price is predicted to be 4.7 ¢/kWh, which is significantly cheaper compared to Wednesday and Thursday, but the possibility of price spikes remains.

**On Saturday** and **Sunday**, prices are expected to be lower, with average prices of 3.1 ¢/kWh and 1.5 ¢/kWh. On these days, wind power production is expected to be strong, helping to keep prices low. **On Monday**, the price level rises slightly to 3.3 ¢/kWh, but remains low. **On Tuesday**, the average price rises to 7.4 ¢/kWh, and the maximum price can rise up to 22.0 ¢/kWh. This is partly due to a low wind power minimum production forecasted at 1256 MW, which may lead to price spikes.

Thus, the week brings varying price developments, especially in the early week. The forecasts for the end of the week anticipate low prices, but the peak prices at the beginning of the week can significantly impact consumers' electricity bills.
