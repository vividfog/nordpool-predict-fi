The start of the week will look pricier, and the clearest standout will be **Wednesday**, with an average of 13,6 ¢ and a forecast maximum of 21,7 ¢. The day’s minimum wind generation will remain exceptionally low, 199 MW, which explains the higher peak. The risk of price spikes will concentrate in the morning at 08:00–10:00 and in the late afternoon to early evening at 16:00–18:00. Also on **Thursday** the risks will persist: the peak will likely fall at 16:00–18:00 (max 21,3 ¢), with weak wind through the day. **Friday**’s variation will highlight the morning at 08:00–10:00 and the early evening at 16:00–18:00, although the expected maximum stays around 14 ¢.

The weekend will be clearly cheaper. **Saturday** is a public holiday, which may lower demand and support a low price level; the day’s higher hours would fall around 10:00–12:00. **Sunday**’s level will likely stay below five cents throughout, with the highest hours around 16:00–18:00. Next **Monday** is expected to bring the week’s lowest average, supported by strong wind; overnight, brief negative moments may occur (bottom about -0,3 ¢).
