| **Thursday** | 1,6 | -0,0 - 5,6 | 4168 - 5967 | 7,5 |
| **Friday** | 11,8 | 2,8 - 23,4 | 500 - 3960 | 5,9 |

| **Sunday** | 7,0 | 4,8 - 10,6 | 1987 - 4091 | 4,7 |
| **Monday** | 10,8 | 5,8 - 18,9 | 1062 - 3057 | 4,0 |
| **Tuesday** | 6,9 | 2,3 - 16,3 | 1528 - 4375 | 3,6 |

Prices over the week will vary clearly. **On Thursday** the lowest average price will be seen, 1,6 ¢. Prices will stay around zero at night and rise in the evening to at most 5,6 ¢. Strong wind generation will support the low price level. **On Wednesday** the average will also remain low, 3,8 ¢, and the intraday variation will stay modest.

The clearest exception will appear in **Friday’s** prices. The daily average will rise to 11,8 ¢ and the maximum is forecast at 23,4 ¢. The highest hour will most likely fall between 10–12. The minimum wind output will drop very low, 500 MW, which explains the unusually high peak price. A risk of individual peak hours is noted, and the realized peak could on Friday exceed the forecast if winds are weaker than expected.

**On Saturday** the average will stay at 11,4 ¢ and the day’s top will reach 18,4 ¢. The highest hours are estimated for 08–10. The wind trough will dip below 1000 MW, sustaining the spike risk; the upper bound could be exceeded in single hours if production weakens further. **On Monday** the average is projected at 10,8 ¢ with the day’s peak between 17–19 (maximum 18,9 ¢). The daily wind minimum will be around 1000 MW, which may reinforce the evening peak.

Midweek the picture will even out. **On Tuesday** the average will be 6,9 ¢, but a single morning spike is possible between 08–10 (maximum 16,3 ¢). **On Sunday** price variation is expected to remain modest; the average will be 7,0 ¢ and the top 10,6 ¢ with no spike mentions. Overall, the most affordable slots will fall on Thursday and Wednesday, while Friday will form the week’s clearly most expensive day.

This is a price forecast, and realized prices may still change, especially if wind conditions deviate from the forecast.
