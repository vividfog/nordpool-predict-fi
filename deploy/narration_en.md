Electricity price expectations for the coming days will vary notably. **Friday** will be the week's most affordable day, with an average daily price of only 0.4 cents per kilowatt-hour. Prices will briefly dip negative overnight into Friday, reaching a minimum of -0.2 cents, and will remain very low throughout the day. In the evening after 7 p.m., prices will rise slightly above two cents at maximum.

On **Saturday**, prices will rise notably from Friday's levels. The day's average price will reach 6.6 cents, and there's a risk of high hourly price spikes. Particularly on Saturday evening between 7 p.m. and 9 p.m., the price peak could surpass the forecasted 17.6 cents. The cause of higher prices will be very low wind power production, dropping to as low as 172 megawatts.

On **Sunday**, prices will continue to carry a risk of individual price spikes. Sunday's average price will be slightly lower than Saturday's, at 6.0 cents. However, price variation during Sunday will be more moderate, with the highest price of 13.0 cents occurring between 7 p.m. and 9 p.m. Wind power production will remain relatively low on Sunday as well, dropping to a minimum of 112 megawatts.

At the start of the new week, prices will decrease slightly from the weekend's level. **Monday's** average price will be moderate at 5.8 cents, but prices on individual hours may approach 11 cents during the evening. On **Tuesday**, the average price will be the lowest among weekdays, at 4.2 cents. Tuesday's hourly price variation will be moderate, with the highest hourly price around seven cents occurring between 7 p.m. and 9 p.m.

**Wednesday's** and **Thursday's** prices will rise again slightly, settling between approximately five and seven cents on average. On both days, the highest prices will appear during morning and evening hours, surpassing 11 cents on Thursday evening between 7 p.m. and 9 p.m.

Overall, electricity prices during the next week will show substantial variability, especially during the weekend. Friday will offer the week's cheapest electricity hours, whereas calm weekend conditions will clearly elevate prices. Weekdays will see prices returning closer to normal levels, though hourly variations will still occur, particularly during morning and evening periods.
