Weekly average prices will mostly settle at an expensive level. The clearly highest day-by-day expectation will fall on **Thursday**, when the average price will rise to 18.0 cents and the day’s peak will reach 28.8 cents. In the background, an exceptionally low wind-power minimum will be seen on the same day, at 902 MW. The end of the week will also stay elevated, with **Friday’s** average at 15.2 cents and **Saturday’s** at 14.8 cents.

The cheapest day will be **Tuesday**, when the average will remain at 11.4 cents and the day’s lowest hour will dip below four cents. The week’s single lowest hourly price will occur early on **Tuesday**, around 00:00–02:00. The highest hourly price will be concentrated on **Thursday** around the middle of the day, roughly 09:00–11:00. A high risk of isolated price spikes has been flagged for every day.
