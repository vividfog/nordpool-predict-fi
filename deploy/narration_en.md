The electricity price forecast for the coming week will show moderate fluctuations, both between days and within individual days. At the start of the week, particularly on **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, average electricity prices will be relatively high, around 6.3‚Äì6.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. Both days will also experience brief periods of higher prices, potentially exceeding 13 cents. These price spikes are expected to appear around 9 o'clock in the morning as well as at 8 o'clock in the evening.

On **Friday**, prices will ease somewhat, with the average daily price settling just above four cents. Although price levels will decrease compared to earlier in the week, individual hours might still approach nearly 10 cents. The highest prices will likely occur in the morning hours, particularly around 9 am.

Over the weekend, prices will significantly decline. **Saturday** will offer the week's lowest prices, with an average of only 1.2 cents. Negative prices will also occur during nighttime hours, with electricity prices dropping as low as minus half a cent per kilowatt-hour. On **Sunday**, prices will remain very low, averaging less than two cents. Early Sunday morning hours will also briefly experience negative price levels.

As the new week begins on **Monday** and continues into **Tuesday**, electricity prices will rise slightly again, settling around five cents. Price variations, however, will be more moderate compared to the early part of the previous week, and no significant price spikes are expected.

Overall, the upcoming week will present consumers with quite varied pricing conditions. Midweek will require preparation for higher peak prices, whereas electricity consumption during the weekend will clearly be more affordable.
