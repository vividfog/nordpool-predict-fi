The weekend price level will stay clearly below four cents. **Friday's** average price will settle around 0.4 ¢. **Saturday** is expected to be slightly cheaper still, and several negative prices will appear during the small hours and the morning. Abundant wind generation, at around 6–7 GW for many hours, will support these figures. **Sunday** will see a rise, but levels will remain low: the average will be about 1.5 ¢ and intraday variation modest.

At the start of the week prices will edge higher but remain inexpensive. **Monday** will post the week's highest average, 3.6 ¢, and the day's top hourly price will approach 6.8 ¢ in the morning. On Tuesday and Wednesday the range will return to around 2–3 ¢. **Thursday** is estimated at 3.2 ¢ on average, with the priciest hours around midday. Wind power is expected to be fairly abundant throughout the week, which will support low averages and keep variability mostly moderate.
