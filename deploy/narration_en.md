*The prices of electricity on the stock exchange will fluctuate moderately in the coming week, but an increase is expected on Friday. The weekend days offer more affordable prices, while the week ends with potential price spikes due to low wind power production.*

The Loviisa 1 nuclear power plant is undergoing maintenance, which began on September 6, 2025, at 10:00 and is expected to end on September 24, 2025, at 00:00. This maintenance may affect the accuracy of the electricity price forecast, as training data is limited during maintenance periods.

In the upcoming week, electricity prices on the stock exchange will vary moderately, but Friday stands out with a significantly higher average price. Friday's expected average price is 7.3 cents, which is considerably higher than on other days. This is partly due to the fact that wind power production is at its lowest on Friday, which may increase the price. On the same day, there is also a risk of price spikes during individual hours.

The weekend begins with more affordable prices on **Saturday** and **Sunday**, where the expected average electricity prices are 1.1 and 2.0 cents, respectively. During these days, the fluctuations in wind power production are significant, but price spikes are only possible on Sunday.

**Monday** and **Wednesday** also offer relatively affordable prices, and particularly on Monday, there might even be negative prices during nighttime hours. In the middle of the week, **Tuesday** and **Thursday** have slightly higher prices, but they still remain below an average of 5 cents.

Wind power production varies throughout the week, but the largest fluctuations occur on Friday, when low production might raise the day‚Äôs maximum price. Temperatures remain within the range of cool weather and do not have a significant impact on prices.
