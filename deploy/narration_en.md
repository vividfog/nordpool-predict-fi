The week’s price level will be mostly low. Daily averages are expected to range between 2,8–7,5 ¢. The cheapest days will be early in the week: **Monday** avg 2,8 ¢ (maximum 4,6 ¢) and **Sunday** 3,6 ¢ (maximum 6,3 ¢). **Friday** will rise to a 7,5 ¢ average, with a daily maximum of 12,6 ¢. On **Wednesday** the average will be 5,4 ¢ with a 1,3–9,2 ¢ range. On **Thursday** the average will be 5,1 ¢ and on **Saturday** 7,4 ¢, and both days will show clear intra-day swings. Plentiful wind output early in the week will support low prices.

The risk of price spikes will be confined to two days. On **Thursday** the evening peak will fall around 17:00–19:00, when the highest hourly prices will reach about 9,0 ¢. On **Saturday** there will be a clearer morning spike around 08:00–10:00; at that time the price will reach about 15,0 ¢. The spike is explained by an exceptionally low minimum wind output the same day (only 732 MW), which is linked to the week’s highest maximum price. The lowest prices will occur on most days during the night and early morning; for example, on **Monday** around 03:00–05:00 the price will dip to 0,5 ¢.
