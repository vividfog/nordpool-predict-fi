In the coming days, electricity exchange prices are expected to remain at a relatively affordable level. However, there will be some variation between individual days. The cheapest day of the week will be **Friday**, with an average price of -0,1 cents per kilowatt-hour. Notably, negative prices will occur on Friday night and early morning, reaching as low as -1,7 cents.

On **Saturday**, average electricity prices will rise to 3,8 cents, and particularly in the evening around 19:00‚Äì21:00, the highest price peaks of the week are forecasted, possibly exceeding 12 cents. The highest prices are influenced by extremely low wind power production, which drops to a minimum of just 175 megawatts during the day. Saturday also carries an increased risk of individual price spikes during these evening hours.

On **Sunday**, the average price will drop again to 1,5 cents, with negative prices anticipated between noon and 16:00 hrs. Although the average daily price is low, there remains a risk of price spikes during individual hours on Sunday as well.

As the new week begins on **Monday**, the average price rises to 3,3 cents. Afternoon and evening hours will again see some of the week's higher price levels, peaking at 6,6 cents between 21:00 and 23:00. Monday's wind power production remains relatively stable, slightly above a thousand megawatts.

Later in the week, prices on **Tuesday**, **Wednesday**, and **Thursday** will remain moderate, but Wednesday and Thursday will have certain hours when prices could rise to 6‚Äì8 cents. Wednesday morning around 08:00‚Äì10:00 and Thursday evening around 19:00‚Äì21:00 will be the periods with the highest prices.

Overall, the coming days will see moderate price developments, with average prices remaining affordable. The greatest fluctuations will occur especially on Saturday and Sunday, when weak wind power generation considerably increases prices during specific hours compared to the rest of the week.
