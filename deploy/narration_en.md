| **Thursday** | 7,7 | 1,6 - 16,3 | 484 - 3241 | 4,8 |
| **Friday** | 8,3 | 0,8 - 17,0 | 518 - 3485 | 4,3 |
| **Saturday** | 2,7 | -0,4 - 7,3 | 292 - 3745 | 4,5 |
| **Sunday** | 0,7 | -0,6 - 3,5 | 2901 - 4836 | 4,6 |
| **Monday** | 1,5 | -0,1 - 4,3 | 2269 - 4907 | 3,4 |
| **Tuesday** | 0,7 | -0,6 - 2,0 | 3649 - 5333 | 4,5 |
| **Wednesday** | 2,1 | -0,4 - 4,8 | 2090 - 5464 | 6,3 |

Pronounced early peaks and low averages later in the week will stand out. **Thursday** and **Friday** averages are expected around 7,7–8,3 ¢, while other days will be in the 0,7–2,7 ¢ range. Based on the day-specific risk notes, price spikes may occur on Thursday around 07–09 (peak forecast 16,3 ¢) and on Friday around 17–19 (17,0 ¢). On both days, minimum wind output will be unusually low—484 MW on Thursday and 518 MW on Friday—which partly explains the higher hourly peaks.

From the weekend onward, the price level is expected to be clearly lower. **Saturday** is expected to average 2,7 ¢, and **Sunday** as well as **Tuesday** will come in at 0,7 ¢. Several negative hours are anticipated: on Saturday evening down to -0,4 ¢; during Sunday night around 01–03 and 03–05 as low as -0,6 ¢; on **Monday** late evening -0,1 ¢; and during Tuesday night around 01–03 -0,6 ¢. Abundant wind early in the week will support low prices, and Saturday is a public holiday, which typically lightens demand and pushes prices down.
