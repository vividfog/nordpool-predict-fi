*Electricity prices are expected to fluctuate significantly next week, especially on Monday and Tuesday when strong price spikes are possible. On Wednesday, prices will drop to low levels due to strong wind power production.*

The Loviisa 2 nuclear power plant is undergoing maintenance, which began on August 17, 2025, at 04:00 and is forecasted to end on September 8, 2025, at 00:00. This maintenance may affect the accuracy of the electricity price forecast, as there is limited training data available during maintenance periods.

Next **Monday**, electricity prices will reach their highest average at 14.4 cents per kilowatt-hour, with significant price fluctuations expected throughout the day. Particularly in the evening, around 19:00 to 21:00, peak prices may rise to as high as 27 cents. Wind power production remains at low levels, which may partly explain the price increase.

**Tuesday** and **Thursday** pose a risk for price spikes during individual hours. Tuesday's forecasted average price is 8.1 cents, but evening hours may see prices rise above 20 cents. A similar situation may occur on Thursday, with an average price of 8.4 cents and a maximum price potentially reaching 16.9 cents. On these days, wind power production does not reach particularly high levels, which could increase price volatility.

On **Wednesday**, electricity prices will drop to the lowest level of the week, with an average price of just 4.1 cents. Wind power production is strong during this time, supporting low prices. **Friday** sees moderate prices, with an average of 6.1 cents, slightly higher than Wednesday but still at a reasonable level.

Price expectations for Saturday and **Sunday** are close to each other, with averages at 7.1 and 7.5 cents, respectively. Sunday also indicates potential price spikes, especially during the evening hours, when prices could rise above 13 cents.
