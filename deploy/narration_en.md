*Electricity prices in the upcoming week will vary significantly, influenced by wind power production. The lowest prices are expected on Sunday and Tuesday, while Thursday and Friday may bring potential price spikes in the mornings and evenings.*

The upcoming week will bring fluctuating electricity prices, with wind power production playing a significant role in determining price levels. **On Sunday**, prices are expected to remain very low due to strong wind power production, with the average daily price anticipated to stay around 0.4 cents. **On Monday**, prices will rise slightly but will still remain below four cents for most of the day. However, morning and evening hours could bring price spikes, especially during the high-demand morning hours.

**Tuesday** appears to be the most affordable day of the week, with price expectations remaining largely negative or very low. This is due to strong wind power production, which balances the price. **On Wednesday**, price spikes are possible, especially in the afternoon when wind power production is at its lowest, and prices could temporarily exceed seven cents.

**Thursday** brings the highest price expectations of the week, with an average price of 4.6 cents and a maximum price rising above nine cents in the morning. This is due to low wind power production. **Friday** continues the week of higher prices, and with wind power production remaining low, price expectations stay around five cents, with potential price spikes in the evening.

As the weekend approaches, **on Saturday**, prices decrease again, but the risk of price spikes remains in individual hours due to fluctuations in wind power.
