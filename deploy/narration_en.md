Price spikes are anticipated during the day, especially in the morning and evening hours, where prices may momentarily exceed 5 cents.

**On Saturday**, prices remain moderate, but individual price spikes may occur during the day, with the maximum price potentially reaching up to 7 cents. This is due to lower wind power production during the day.

**On Monday**, electricity prices rise to the highest level of the week, averaging 3.6 cents. This is partly due to lower wind power production, which contributes to price increases, particularly during morning and evening hours.

**On Tuesday**, price trends are more moderate, but fluctuations during the day may occur due to wind power production. The average price is around 2.7 cents, and the day's lowest price could even be negative.

In the middle of the week, **Wednesday's** prices remain reasonable, with an average price of around 3.4 cents. Wind power production is at its highest this week, which stabilizes price trends. **Thursday's** prices decrease slightly, with an average price of 2.3 cents.
