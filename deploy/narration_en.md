The forecasts for next week's electricity market look variable. **Friday** offers relatively cheap electricity prices, with an average price of 1.9 ¬¢/kWh. Prices fluctuate somewhat throughout the day but remain moderate. **Saturday** and **Sunday** continue the affordable trend, with price expectations remaining very low, due to strong wind power production.

In contrast, **Monday** brings a clear rise in price level, with the average price climbing to 7.1 ¬¢/kWh. This is partly due to a drop in wind power production. Price peaks may occur during individual hours, so consumers should stay alert.

**Tuesday** is the most expensive day of the week, with the average price rising to 11.8 ¬¢/kWh. Possible price spikes are also notable, especially during morning and evening hours. Lower wind power production is one reason for the higher prices. On **Wednesday**, prices decrease slightly, but the risk of price spikes remains high.

Towards the end of the week, on **Thursday**, the price level decreases again, and more stable development is expected. Wind power production remains at a good level, contributing to price stabilization.
