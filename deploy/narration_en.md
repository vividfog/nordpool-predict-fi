| **Tuesday** | 7.1 | 2.0 - 15.1 | 1238 - 2598 | 14.4 |
| **Wednesday** | 6.0 | 2.8 - 11.4 | 1623 - 2433 | 14.8 |

In the upcoming week's electricity price forecast, significant fluctuations are expected. **Monday** will see the highest price expectations, with an average price of 11.5 ¢/kWh and a maximum price rising to 22.0 ¢. This is partly due to low wind power production, which can occasionally drop well below 1000 MW. **Sunday** is also expected to have higher prices, especially in the evening, when prices could reach up to 23.4 ¢.

On **Tuesday**, prices will significantly decrease, with an average price of 7.1 ¢. This is due to increased wind power production, which smooths out price variations. **Wednesday** will continue the downward trend with an average price of 6.0 ¢. Wind power production remains at a moderate level, helping to keep prices moderate.

**Thursday** is forecasted to see a price increase again, with an average price of 7.9 ¢, but the maximum price remains below 13 ¢, reducing the risk of price spikes. **Friday**, on the other hand, offers the week's lowest prices, with an average price of only 3.7 ¢, due to abundant wind power production.

At the weekend's threshold on **Saturday**, prices slightly increase, with an average price of 5.6 ¢. Although wind power production is at a reasonable level, individual price spikes may still occur later in the evening, when the maximum price could rise to 15.0 ¢.
