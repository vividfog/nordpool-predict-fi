Very low prices are expected at the start of the week. On **Tuesday** the average price is expected to be 0,4 ¢ with a 0,1–1,0 ¢ range. On **Wednesday** the level will remain low, average 0,6 ¢, and a few negative night hours are projected (down to −0,5 ¢). The early‑week level will be explained by abundant wind generation.

After Wednesday, upward pressure is anticipated as winds weaken. On **Thursday** a spike risk will appear: the peak would land around 16:00–18:00 at about 16,3 ¢. On **Friday** the spike would likely hit the morning around 08:00–10:00 (up to 10,7 ¢). On **Saturday** prices should stay more even, 1,0–4,2 ¢. On **Sunday**, a public holiday, the average will be 3,4 ¢, but a single peak may occur around 09:00–11:00 (up to 7,5 ¢). The most expensive day is expected to be next **Monday**: the average rises to 10,3 ¢ and the evening peak would fall around 17:00–19:00 at about 18,6 ¢. The peak will be explained by an exceptionally low wind minimum (715 MW), clearly below 2 000 MW.
