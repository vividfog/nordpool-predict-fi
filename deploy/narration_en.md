*The electricity price development in Finland next week varies significantly, with the forecast indicating the highest price on Monday. Variations in wind power production and low output influence price expectations, and the risk of price spikes is notable, especially on Sunday and Monday.*

The Loviisa 2 nuclear power plant is undergoing maintenance, which began on August 17, 2025, at 04:00 and is expected to end on September 8, 2025, at 00:00. The maintenance might impact the forecast's accuracy, as there is limited training data available during maintenance periods.

Forecast updated on Monday at 21:07.

Electricity prices in the coming week will vary significantly between days. On **Tuesday**, the highest maximum price is forecasted, reaching up to 17.0 Â¢/kWh, which is linked to notably low wind power output, possibly explaining the price increase. On **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, prices are expected to remain low, likely due to strong wind power reaching peak levels of over 3700 MW. The risk of price spikes is also low on these days.

On **Friday** and **Saturday**, prices are expected to rise somewhat, with a risk of price spikes during specific hours on both days. **Friday's** maximum rises to 14.6 Â¢/kWh, while on **Saturday**, the highest prices are projected at 13.0 Â¢. On **Sunday**, there is a high risk of price spikes, with the maximum price potentially reaching 17.3 Â¢/kWh, making it the second high-price day of the week.

Next **Monday**, the highest average price of the week is forecasted at 10.8 Â¢/kWh, and the maximum could reach up to 20.6 Â¢/kWh. This, combined with low wind power, may partly explain the projected price level. Due to low wind power production and the risk of price spikes, higher prices may be anticipated.
