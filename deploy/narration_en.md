**Thursday's** forecast indicates that electricity prices will remain relatively stable without significant price spikes, with an average price of 2.4 cents per kilowatt-hour. There will be ample wind power available, which helps keep prices low. **On Friday,** however, potential price spikes are expected, especially during morning and evening hours, when prices could rise to as high as 18 cents. This may be due to significant fluctuations in wind power throughout the day.

**Saturday** and **Sunday** will see moderate electricity prices, but the risk of price spikes remains. On Saturday, the highest expected price is 13.5 cents, and on Sunday, it is 14.6 cents. On Sunday, the average wind power production is lower, which might contribute to rising prices.

**Monday's** forecast shows the highest prices of the week, with an average price of 9.6 cents. This price increase may be partly due to low wind power production. The risk of price spikes is high, and peak hours are likely to occur in the evening. Forecasts for **Tuesday** and **Wednesday** show more moderate prices, but there is still a risk of price spikes on Wednesday, with prices potentially reaching up to 15.5 cents.
