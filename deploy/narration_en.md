|:-------------|:----------------:|:----------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| **Friday** | 0,3 | -0,0 - 0,6 | 4612 - 6301 | 2,1 |
| **Saturday** | 1,7 | -0,1 - 4,3 | 3241 - 6625 | 3,3 |
| **Sunday** | 4,0 | 1,7 - 7,7 | 1688 - 3921 | 2,9 |
| **Monday** | 9,7 | 3,3 - 17,7 | 729 - 3740 | 2,2 |
| **Tuesday** | 9,3 | 5,0 - 14,1 | 1025 - 2598 | 1,5 |
| **Wednesday** | 7,9 | 4,8 - 10,5 | 1673 - 3082 | -0,1 |
| **Thursday** | 8,2 | 3,3 - 12,1 | 1646 - 4648 | -0,2 |

The week’s price trend will look split in two. **Friday** and **Saturday** will average 0,3–1,7 ¢, with brief zero and slight negative hours at night. Strong wind power will explain the low levels. **Sunday** will climb close to four cents. The most expensive days will be **Monday** (avg 9,7 ¢, max 17,7 ¢) and **Tuesday** (avg 9,3 ¢, max 14,1 ¢). Monday’s very high peak will be tied to exceptionally low wind output at the minimum (729 MW), which explains the sharper spike.

Spike risk will stand out on **Monday**, most likely around 17:00–19:00. **Tuesday** may see elevated hourly prices in the morning, roughly 8:00–10:00. The midweek will calm down: on **Wednesday** and **Thursday** holidays may lower demand and show in averages (7,9–8,2 ¢). The cheapest moments will fall during the night and early morning, while late afternoon to evening will often be pricier, especially at the start of the week.
