*The electricity price trend for the upcoming week varies significantly: price spikes are expected on Wednesday and Monday, while prices remain close to zero on Friday and the weekend as wind power increases.*

**Loviisa 1** nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance. The maintenance started on September 6, 2025, at 10:00 AM and is expected to end on October 2, 2025, at 12:00 PM. The maintenance shutdown may affect the accuracy of the price forecast as there is limited training data available from periods of maintenance shutdowns.

The forecast was updated on Tuesday at 09:08 AM.

Electricity prices for the upcoming week vary significantly. **Wednesday** stands out with the highest average price of 10.7 cents, and price spikes are expected in the evening between 5 PM and 7 PM. **Monday** also has a heightened risk of price spikes, particularly between 6 PM and 8 PM, when electricity prices could rise higher than forecasted. These spikes are influenced by low wind power production, which drops below 1000 megawatts.

**Friday** and the weekend offer more affordable prices. On Friday, the average price is expected to be 1.9 cents, and on Saturday and Sunday, prices drop close to zero. This affordability is partly due to strong wind power, which significantly increases the electricity supply.

While **Thursday** and **Tuesday** have moderate prices, the risk of price spikes on Monday makes it the most challenging day to predict accurately for the week. The maintenance shutdown of the nuclear power plant may add uncertainty to the forecasts, but abundant wind power could help balance the situation towards the end of the week.
