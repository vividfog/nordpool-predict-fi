*Next week's electricity price development is expected to be variable, as fluctuations in wind power production impact price expectations. Especially on Monday, high prices are anticipated due to weak wind power production, potentially causing price spikes.*

Loviisa 2 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance. The maintenance began on 17.8.2025 at 04:00 and is expected to end on 8.9.2025 at 00:00. Such a maintenance outage can affect the accuracy of the forecast, as training data from maintenance periods is limited.

The forecast was updated on Wednesday at 14:24.

The upcoming week will bring variable electricity prices. **Thursday** is expected to have the lowest average price of the week, only 1.2 cents, due to strong wind power production. **Friday's** price expectations rise, with possible individual price spikes. This is partly due to fluctuations in wind power production. **Saturday** and **Sunday** will see similar price expectations as Friday, with a continued risk of price spikes.

**Monday** stands out with the highest average price, 9.8 cents, and a maximum price of 23.4 cents. This is due to weak wind power production, which falls below 1000 MW. **Tuesday** sees a drop in price levels again, though the risk of price spikes remains. **Wednesday** shows a slight increase in price expectations, but still below Monday's level.

Throughout the week, the price trend is particularly influenced by variations in wind power production. Wind power is strong on Thursday but significantly weakens by Monday, leading to price increases. Therefore, electricity consumers should be especially cautious on Monday, when price spikes are likely.
