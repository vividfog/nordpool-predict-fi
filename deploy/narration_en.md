| **Wednesday** | 0,8 | 0,1 - 1,4 | 4242 - 6374 | 1,4 |
| **Thursday** | 0,6 | -0,6 - 2,8 | 5614 - 6832 | 1,4 |
| **Friday** | 1,7 | -0,7 - 4,5 | 2233 - 5828 | 2,2 |

Power prices would remain very low from **Wednesday** to **Saturday**. All of these days’ averages would stay under two cents, and from Thursday to Saturday prices would also dip below zero during some hours. Strong wind generation would support the low level. From **Sunday** onward the price level would turn upward: the average would rise to 4,6 cents and intraday variation would already be larger. Next **Monday** the average would rise to 7,1 cents and next **Tuesday** to 11,0 cents, which would be clearly the week’s highest. Tuesday’s maximum would reach 20,6 cents.

Price spikes could occur on Sunday in the early evening around 17:00–19:00, when the price would reach about 12 ¢ according to the forecast. Next Monday the peak would most likely fall at 08:00–10:00 (maximum 16,2 ¢), and on Tuesday again at 17:00–19:00 (maximum 20,6 ¢). The higher peaks on Monday and Tuesday would be explained by low minimum wind output, which would drop to 1 361 and 1 049 MW, respectively.
