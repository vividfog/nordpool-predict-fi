Next week, electricity market prices will fluctuate significantly between different days. **Wednesday** will see the highest average price of the week at 12.5 ¢/kWh, with the highest individual peak prices reaching up to 23.9 ¢/kWh. This may be due to low wind power production, averaging below 1300 megawatts. In contrast, **Thursday** offers the most affordable average price at 1.8 ¢/kWh, due to strong wind power exceeding 3000 MW.

During the weekend, prices are also exceptionally low. On **Friday**, the average price drops to 0.4 ¢/kWh and on Saturday even turns negative at -0.5 ¢/kWh. This is due to very strong wind power rising above 4000 megawatts on both days.

**Tuesday** and **Wednesday** warrant preparation for price spikes, especially during morning and evening hours. For instance, on **Tuesday**, a price spike might occur between 16:00 and 18:00, while on **Wednesday**, high prices could hit between 8:00 and 10:00 or between 18:00 and 20:00.
