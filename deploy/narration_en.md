| **Monday** | 7,6 | 0,0 - 19,9 | 2084 - 6266 | 6,5 |
| **Tuesday** | 17,2 | 7,0 - 29,0 | 466 - 1859 | 6,4 |
| **Wednesday** | 10,2 | 2,6 - 22,9 | 535 - 4264 | 6,4 |
| **Thursday** | 2,1 | 1,1 - 3,3 | 3397 - 4706 | 7,5 |
| **Friday** | 5,6 | 1,8 - 10,2 | 2323 - 4404 | 5,9 |
| **Saturday** | 6,0 | 3,2 - 11,6 | 1876 - 3108 | 5,2 |

The week’s price trajectory is expected to be split. **Monday** will average around 7,6 ¢ and volatility will be high, from near-zero prices before dawn to evening hours approaching 20 ¢. **Tuesday** will clearly set the weekly peak: the average is forecast at 17,2 ¢ and the highest hour will reach 29,0 ¢. Average wind output will stay at a very low level (892 MW), and the minimum drops to 466 MW, which clearly explains the higher maximum price.

The risk of price spikes will be pronounced especially on Tuesday’s hours, so peaks are forecast around 9–11 and 19–21. Both windows coincide with low wind output, and individual hours may materialize above the forecast maximum.

**Wednesday** will also feature spike risk. The day’s average is projected at 10,2 ¢ with a maximum of 22,9 ¢. The peak will fall in the morning around 8–10. In the evening hours the level will ease clearly, and the day’s low will remain at 2,6 ¢.

The most affordable stretch of the week is expected toward the end. **Thursday** will range between 1,1–3,3 ¢ with an average of 2,1 ¢. Strong wind (over 4000 MW on average) will push prices broadly down. **Friday’s** average will stay at 5,6 ¢ without notable deviations.

The weekend level will remain moderate. **Saturday** will average 6,0 ¢ with a range of 3,2–11,6 ¢. **Sunday** will return close to Thursday-like low levels: the average will be 2,4 ¢ and wind will again be strong, supporting low prices throughout the day.
