Early week will stand out as more expensive. On **Monday** the average price is expected at 9,9 ¢ with a daily high of 16,1 ¢, and the spike risk will focus on the evening around 17:00–19:00. On **Tuesday** the average will rise to 11,6 ¢ and the maximum is forecast at 23,0 ¢ around 08:00–10:00. Wind power minimum that day will drop to 898 MW, which explains the unusually high peak. **Sunday** is a public holiday; the average price is projected at 3,2 ¢, but there will be a risk of a single peak around 10:00–12:00.

Later in the week prices will settle clearly lower. On **Wednesday** the average is expected to be 3,7 ¢, on **Thursday** 3,0 ¢, on **Friday** 1,9 ¢ and on **Saturday** 2,9 ¢. During Friday night and early morning hours prices will briefly dip to 0,0 ¢. From Wednesday onward wind output will strengthen (over 3000 MW on average), pushing prices down for the remainder of the week. The week will split in two: early‑week weak winds lift prices, whereas late‑week strong winds keep prices mostly below four cents.
