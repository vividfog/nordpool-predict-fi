**On Wednesday**, the highest average price of the week is expected, rising to 7.7 cents per kilowatt-hour. This day also stands out with the highest maximum price, which could reach over 20 cents. This price expectation is related to the low wind power production, which is on average only 1211 MW on Wednesday. **Thursday** and **Friday**, on the other hand, appear to be cheaper days, with prices staying below one cent on average, and ample wind power available, partly explaining the lower prices.

**On Saturday** and **Sunday**, electricity prices rise slightly but remain relatively low. However, there is a risk of price spikes on Saturday, which could raise prices during individual hours, especially in the morning or evening. Price spikes are also possible on Sunday, so careful price comparison is advisable.

The beginning of the week, **Monday** and **Tuesday**, continues the affordable trend, with prices remaining reasonably low, although prices may temporarily rise on Tuesday. Wind power production is normal on these days, supporting stable price levels.
