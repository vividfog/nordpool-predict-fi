At the start of the week, prices will remain at a higher level. **Monday** will pair the week’s highest maximum, 22,7 ¢, with a very low wind minimum (1002 MW), which explains intraday increases. **Tuesday** is expected to carry a risk of hourly price spikes, concentrated in the morning 08:00–10:00, with a peak around 22,5 ¢. **Wednesday** shows a similar spike risk in the evening 17:00–19:00, with the day’s high near 19,5 ¢. The average prices for these days will hover between 13,9 and 14,9 cents.

From **Thursday** onward the price level will ease markedly, and the weekend will stay inexpensive: **Friday** averages 4,3 ¢, **Saturday** 3,0 ¢ and **Sunday** 4,0 ¢. Strong wind generation later in the week will explain the low price level. The week’s lowest moments will fall on Saturday night and morning hours, when prices are expected in the 1,8–3,5 ¢ range. Higher moments will be seen early in the week, while the weekend will appear steadily moderate.
