Prices over the week will be variable. **On Friday**, the level will stand out clearly: the average price is expected to reach 15,6 ¢ and the day's peak 33,4 ¢. The minimum wind output will drop very low, to 637 MW, which explains the intraday price increase.

**On Saturday**, there will be an elevated risk of costly individual hours. Between 08–10 in the morning, the price is expected to climb toward the day's upper end, up to 18,0 ¢. The risk is supported by an unusually low wind minimum of 866 MW. The daily average is projected at 11,0 ¢.

**On Sunday**, prices will stay low as strong winds (within the day even above 5000 MW) increase supply. The 4,8–8,3 ¢ range points to even hours. **On Wednesday**, the situation will be similar: wind power will be plentiful throughout the day and the range will remain at 2,3–6,7 ¢, pulling the week's average down.

**On Monday**, the average price is expected to rise to 13,5 ¢. The largest increase will likely occur between 18–20 in the evening, when the peak hour is projected at 23,8 ¢. Behind this is a low wind minimum of 1103 MW. **On Tuesday**, the risk concentrates on the 08–10 morning hours, when the price can reach 18,6 ¢. The day's minimum remains at 1315 MW, which can amplify the morning pressure even though the average is estimated at 8,9 ¢.

**On Thursday**, the risk of individual peak hours will be weighted toward the evening, around 17–19, when the day's maximum is expected to be 15,2 ¢. The minimum stays at 1146 MW, but the daily average remains at 9,2 ¢. The week's cheapest hours will likely occur in the early hours of Wednesday (around 03–05, closer to 2–3 ¢) and in Friday's early hours (01–03, about 1,8–1,9 ¢).
