The upcoming week begins with stable price development, as the predicted average prices for **Friday** and **Saturday** are at a low level, at 2.8 and 1.8 cents per kilowatt-hour. **Friday's** abundant wind power production helps to keep prices low. On **Saturday**, the price expectations are even lower, with ample wind power available, explaining the affordable prices.

Starting from **Sunday**, the price development remains moderate. **Sunday** is forecasted to even have negative minimum prices, and wind power production remains high, keeping the average price low at just 1.2 cents per kilowatt-hour. However, prices begin to rise in the following days.

On **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, significantly higher average prices of 10.6 and 12.8 cents per kilowatt-hour are expected. During these days, wind power production is considerably lower, partially explaining the higher prices. Particularly on **Tuesday**, there is a high risk of price spikes during individual hours, such as in the morning and evening, when wind power is scarce and demand may be high.

The week ends with **Thursday**, when the average price slightly decreases to 8.3 cents per kilowatt-hour. There is more wind power available, and the risk of price spikes is present, but not as significant as earlier in the week.
