*Electricity prices will fluctuate significantly in the upcoming week, with the cheapest hours even dipping into negative territory, while Wednesday is expected to see the week's highest average price and individual price spikes, partly explained by very low wind power production.*

During the upcoming week, electricity prices will vary considerably from day to day. Clearly, the cheapest day will be **Monday**, when the average price remains very low, approximately 0.3 cents. During the early morning hours, prices will even dip slightly into negative territory.

From Tuesday onward, prices will rise notably. On **Tuesday**, the average price will already approach five cents, and significant price spikes are expected at certain hours. The highest prices will occur in the evening between 19:00 and 21:00, when the expected maximum price exceeds 14 cents. Tuesday's price increase will partly be explained by the extremely low minimum wind power production, which will drop to just 451 megawatts.

However, the most expensive day of the week will be **Wednesday**, when the average price is expected to rise above seven cents. Wednesday's peak price will occur in the morning between 8:00 and 10:00, with electricity prices possibly climbing as high as 14 cents. Wind power production will also remain very weak on Wednesday, increasing the risk of price spikes.

On **Thursday**, the average price will be slightly lower than Wednesday, around 6.4 cents. Again, the highest prices will concentrate in the evening, between 19:00 and 21:00, with peak prices exceeding 13 cents. Wind power production will remain relatively low on Thursday as well, partly influencing the higher prices.

Heading into the weekend, prices will settle down somewhat. On **Friday**, the average price will again drop below three cents, and briefly negative prices are expected overnight. On Saturday and Sunday, average prices will stabilize around five cents, but on both days individual peak prices will clearly exceed ten cents. Saturday's highest price, 11.3 cents, will occur in the evening between 19:00 and 21:00, while Sunday's similar price level, nearly 11 cents, will be reached between 20:00 and 22:00.
