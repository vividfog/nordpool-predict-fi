The upcoming week shows a fluctuating price trend for electricity. **Sunday** stands out with the highest expected maximum price, potentially reaching 13.9 cents. This is partly due to low wind power production at a minimum of 918 megawatts. **Thursday**, on the other hand, is forecasted to be the most expensive day of the week, with an average price rising to 8.6 cents and a maximum price potentially reaching 17.5 cents. The high price on Thursday is attributed to particularly low wind power production, dropping to a minimum of 951 megawatts.

At the beginning of the week, on Monday and Tuesday, electricity prices are expected to remain low, with average prices only around 1.2 to 1.4 cents. This is primarily due to strong wind power production exceeding an average of 4,000 megawatts. On Wednesday, the price trend is moderate, but individual hours may experience price spikes.

Towards the end of the week, Friday is anticipated to have an average price of 5.4 cents, and individual price spikes may occur as wind power production falls below 2,000 megawatts. On Saturday, prices are expected to be more affordable, with an average price of 2.4 cents and a maximum price remaining below six cents.
