Next week's electricity market will see variations, particularly on **Tuesday**, when the average price will rise to 10.2 ¢/kWh. Price spikes are expected on this day, with the maximum price potentially reaching 21.2 ¢/kWh. **Tuesday's** low wind power production partly explains the higher prices.

The most affordable days of the week are **Saturday** and **Sunday**, with average prices remaining low at 0.1 ¢/kWh and 0.5 ¢/kWh. These prices are particularly attractive to consumers, partly due to high wind power production.

On **Wednesday**, the average price will be 5.3 ¢/kWh, slightly higher than at the beginning of the week. **Monday** and **Friday** prices will remain moderate, with both days having an average price of 4.1 ¢/kWh. **Thursday's** price expectations are also reasonable, at 3.7 ¢/kWh.

The overall price trend for the week suggests that the most significant fluctuations will be midweek, particularly on **Tuesday**, when the risk of price spikes is highlighted. On other days, no significant deviations in prices are expected.
