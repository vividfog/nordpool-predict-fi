The week's electricity price forecast clearly indicates an upward trend. The cheapest days will be over the weekend, while higher average prices are expected at the beginning and middle of next week.

On **Friday** and **Saturday**, average prices remain moderate, around one cent per kilowatt-hour. On both days, prices will even dip negative during nighttime. Early on **Saturday** at 4 am, prices are expected to reach -0.2 cents. On **Sunday**, prices will rise slightly, with an average forecasted at 2.1 cents. Negative prices will still occur around 1 am on Sunday morning (-0.3 ¬¢/kWh).

As the week turns to **Monday**, prices will shift notably upward. Monday's average price will rise to 4.8 cents, with the highest hourly prices reaching 8.6 cents in the evening around 8-10 pm. This increase is partly explained by weaker wind power production, which is expected to remain relatively low throughout the day.

On **Tuesday**, average prices will decrease slightly compared to Monday but will remain elevated compared to the weekend. The average price will be around 3.3 cents. Tuesday's highest prices will occur around 8 am, reaching 5.7 cents per hour.

The most expensive days of the week will be **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, with expected average prices around five cents. Wednesday's maximum price of 9.1 cents will occur in the morning between 8-10 am. Thursday's peak price (8.2 ¬¢) will fall in the evening hours between 7-9 pm. On both days, wind power production will remain moderate, partly explaining the elevated price levels.
