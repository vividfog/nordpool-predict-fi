The week's electricity markets are expected to vary significantly across different days. **Tuesday** and **Wednesday** stand out in the forecasts as days with higher prices. On Tuesday, electricity prices are expected to rise up to 24.6 cents per kWh, with an average price forecasted at 8.4 cents. This could be due to both fluctuating wind power production and other market factors. On Wednesday, the average electricity price is predicted to rise even higher, to 12.8 cents, with a maximum price reaching 26.1 cents. On these days, price spikes are possible during afternoon and evening hours.

The most affordable days of the week are expected to be **Friday** and **Saturday**, when electricity average prices will remain very low, even below one cent on Friday. This is due to strong wind power production, which is predicted to be significant, especially on Friday, reaching up to 4643 MW. The low weekend prices offer opportunities for consumers to take advantage of cheap electricity.

The week's price development is clearly variable, offering both challenges and opportunities for electricity consumers. It is important to note that the risk of price spikes is most pronounced on Tuesday and Wednesday.
