The upcoming week in electricity prices appears variable, but generally remains within affordable ranges. **Tuesday** seems to be the most stable day of the week, with a low average price and strong wind power production. On **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, prices are expected to rise slightly higher, especially on Thursday, when the maximum price could exceed 13 cents. The low minimum wind power production on Thursday partly explains the higher maximum price on this day.

**Friday** prices are moderate, but there is a risk of price spikes. On Saturday and Sunday, prices decrease again, with Sunday expected to be the cheapest day of the week, with an average price of only 0.8 cents. The week concludes on Monday, when prices could rise slightly, but the risk of price spikes is low.

Wind power production is expected to fluctuate significantly throughout the week, affecting price variations. On Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, price spikes could occur particularly during morning and evening hours, so consumers should be aware of these times. Overall, the week's price trends are moderate, with no major anomalies expected.
