In the coming week, electricity price trends appear to vary significantly, with the risk of price spikes existing particularly on **Tuesday**, **Wednesday**, **Thursday**, and **Friday**. The highest average price is expected on **Wednesday**, where prices could rise to 8 cents. Variations in wind power production affect prices, with **Wednesday** anticipated to have the lowest average production, partly explaining the higher price levels.

**Saturday** and **Sunday** stand out as the cheapest days of the week, with Sunday potentially seeing an average price drop to negative values. This is partly due to strong wind power, which lowers electricity prices. On **Saturday** and **Sunday**, wind power production is expected to be higher than on other days, which partly explains the low prices.

Next **Monday**, prices may rise slightly from the weekend, but will still remain low compared to the beginning of the week. Wind power production remains at a high level, helping to keep prices moderate.
