The upcoming week's electricity price expectations vary according to several factors. **Sunday** is forecasted to have the lowest average price of the week, around 0.7 ¢/kWh, partly due to moderate wind power production. The day's maximum price also remains below two cents, making it the most affordable day. **Thursday** and **Monday** show higher average price forecasts, around 3.4–3.5 ¢/kWh, which may be related to low wind power levels. Additionally, these days are expected to have price spikes, so consumers should be cautious, especially during morning and evening hours.

**Friday** has an average price slightly below the week's average, with plenty of wind power available. This combination is expected to keep price spikes at bay. **Saturday** has a low average price of 1.6 ¢/kWh, but there is also a potential for price spikes, which could affect consumers' electricity usage. **Tuesday** price expectations are slightly higher than the weekly average but remain reasonable, with no major price fluctuations forecasted.

Heading into Wednesday, wind power production increases significantly, contributing to a decrease in prices. The average price for Wednesday is expected to be 1.3 ¢/kWh, making it one of the most affordable days of the week, despite the risk of price spikes.
