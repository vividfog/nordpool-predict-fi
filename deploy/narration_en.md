The upcoming week's electricity price forecasts show significant variations. **Wednesday** sees the highest price expectations, with the average price rising to 9.2 cents. Price spikes are also forecasted for this day, particularly in the evening around 8-10 PM. **Thursday** sees prices rising even further, with an average price of 15.0 ¢ and the day's maximum price exceeding 28 ¢, which may be due to low wind power production falling below 350 MW. **Friday** sees prices stabilizing, with the expected average price at only 7.4 ¢ as wind power production returns to more normal levels.

**Saturday** and **Sunday** see further price declines, with Sunday being the most affordable day of the week with an average price of 4.8 ¢. This might be linked to higher wind power production on Sunday, exceeding 2600 MW. **Monday** sees a slight increase in prices but remains moderate at 6.3 cents. Wind power production remains high on Monday, which may help keep prices reasonable. **Tuesday** sees a slight increase in prices, with an expected average price of 7.4 ¢.
