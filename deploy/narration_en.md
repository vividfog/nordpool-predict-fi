In the first half of the week, the price level will remain elevated: from Tuesday to Friday daily averages will be 13,3–14,0 ¢. The highest single hours will be seen especially on **Wednesday** and **Thursday**. On Wednesday the peak will be in the morning around 08:00–10:00, when the hourly price will reach up to 21,3 ¢. On Thursday the peak will fall in the evening at 17:00–19:00 and reach 22,0 ¢. On both days, minimum wind output will remain well below 1 000 MW, which explains the higher maximum price; the prices of individual peak hours can therefore come in higher than forecast. On **Friday**, too, the evening emphasis will occur at 17:00–19:00, with a maximum expected at 19,3 ¢. On **Saturday** a spike risk is noted, and the elevated hours will concentrate in the evening at 18:00–20:00, although the day’s average will be clearly lower.

The most affordable periods will fall on the weekend and early next week. On **Sunday** the average price will be 4,2 ¢, and the earliest hours will slide to about 2–3 ¢ (01:00–03:00). Ample wind generation, 1 752–5 128 MW, will push prices down. On **Monday** the price level will remain moderate: the average will be 7,4 ¢ and the range 3,5–9,6 ¢. The week’s most expensive single hours thus look set to fall on Thursday evening, while the cheapest electricity is forecast for the early hours of Sunday.
