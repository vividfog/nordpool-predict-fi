Compared with the start of the week, prices will vary widely later on. **Thursday’s** average price will settle at 7,5 cents, and the risk of single-hour spikes will lean to the morning around 7–9. **Friday’s** average will be the week’s highest, 10,6 ¢, and the evening peak will land around 16–18, when the level will reach as high as 21,6 ¢ in the forecast. On Friday the minimum wind output will drop to 365 megawatts, and the week’s highest hourly price will occur the same day; the low wind explains the level. **Saturday’s** demand will be dampened by a public holiday, but a single spike could show up in the morning around 8–10.

After Sunday the price level will turn clearly low, and negative prices will be expected at times. **Sunday** night prices will dip below zero, and cheap hours will be widespread into the early week. Monday’s average will be 2,6 cents, while Tuesday and Wednesday will settle at 0,8 ¢. Negative levels will likely appear from Saturday evening and during the nights of Sunday, Tuesday and Wednesday. The week’s most expensive hours will be confined to early Friday evening, while the cheapest periods will cluster on Sunday and during night and evening hours early in the week.
