The weekly price profile will split in two. **Monday** will post the highest average, 7,8 ¢, while the other days will settle clearly lower, mostly within 0,6–3,2 ¢. The lowest averages will appear on **Wednesday** (0,6 ¢) and **Sunday** (1,6 ¢).

On **Monday** intraday variation will be large. The week’s highest hourly price will occur around 8:00–10:00, when the level touches 19,7 ¢. Night and late-evening hours will hover near 1–4 ¢. The wind power minimum will drop to just 1 941 MW, which helps explain the higher peak.

Negative prices will be expected for the night and early morning on **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**. On Tuesday the late evening will dip below zero, and on Wednesday 00:00–06:00 will stay negative while daytime will run around 0–2 ¢. Wind generation will be abundant on Wednesday (average above 5 000 MW), keeping the price very low. **Thursday** will remain muted; the early night will again feature a few negative hours, and the day will top out near 5,0 ¢.

For **Friday** a risk of single-hour spikes will be flagged. The highest hour will fall around 17:00–19:00 at 10,5 ¢. The day’s wind minimum will slip below 2 000 MW (1 922 MW), supporting the higher hourly level. The weekend will even out: **Saturday** and **Sunday** averages will be 2,1 and 1,6 ¢, and hours will stay within 0,1–4,4 ¢. Sunday evening will not feature pronounced peaks.
