During the upcoming week, the prices of exchange electricity will vary moderately on different days. **Friday** stands out with the lowest average price of 2.8 cents per kilowatt-hour. The abundant average wind power production helps keep prices low. On the other hand, **Wednesday** is expected to have the highest average price at 4.5 cents, with the day's maximum price potentially reaching up to 9 cents. This is partly due to low wind power, which raises prices, especially in the evening.

The lowest prices of the week will occur in the early hours of Sunday, when electricity can be obtained at a negative price of -0.2 cents. Higher wind power production on Sunday balances the average price for the day. **Thursday** and **Saturday** will see relatively stable price developments without significant deviations.

Price spikes may occur during individual hours, especially in the mornings and evenings. On **Thursday** and **Monday** evenings, prices are expected to rise above 6 cents, so consumers should be alert. Throughout the week, wind power production will vary, affecting intra-day price fluctuations.
