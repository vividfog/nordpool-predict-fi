On **Saturday** the average will stay at 7,1 ¢ and on **Sunday** at 4,8 ¢, the lowest of the week. Sunday’s low level will be explained by strong wind generation, averaging 3 676 MW. On Friday winds will be very weak (avg 1 025 MW), which supports the higher price level.

Price spikes will be anticipated on several days. On **Thursday** a single spike may fall around 15:00–17:00. On **Friday** the spike risk will be high, with a likely peak at 17:00–19:00; a very low wind-power minimum (505 MW) explains the expected 26,0 ¢ top. On **Saturday** a spike may occur late at night around 23:00–01:00. On **Tuesday** the peak will most likely sit at 16:00–18:00; a low wind minimum (993 MW) is linked to the 20,3 ¢ maximum. On **Wednesday** the spike risk will concentrate at 16:00–18:00; a low wind minimum (1 341 MW) is associated with the 17,7 ¢ peak.
