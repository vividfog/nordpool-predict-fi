The upcoming week's electricity price expectations show significant daily variations. **Tuesday** and **Wednesday** are expected to have higher average prices, around 6.2‚Äì6.4 ¬¢/kWh, with prices potentially rising to 12‚Äì14 cents on these days. This is partly due to fluctuations in wind power production, which is at a low level, especially with Wednesday's low production of 232 MW.

**Thursday** is expected to maintain high price levels, with the maximum price reaching 12.9 cents during the day. By Friday, the average price drops significantly to 4.2 cents, with wind power production remaining relatively stable, preventing major price fluctuations.

Over the weekend, on **Saturday** and **Sunday**, electricity is forecasted to be affordable, with average prices at 3.7 and 2.3 cents. Sunday is expected to see the lowest prices, with the minimum price potentially dropping to as low as 0.2 cents. This also reflects the increase in wind power, which helps keep prices low.

Next **Monday**, prices will remain low, with an average price of about 2.3 cents. Wind power is expected to be stronger, which partly explains the lower prices.
