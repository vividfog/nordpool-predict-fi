Price trends will diverge at the start of the week. **Monday**, the day’s average price is expected to reach 8,9 ¢, and the peak would rise to 16,0 ¢ in the evening at 17–19. A high spike risk has been indicated for this day, and the very low minimum wind output (740 MW) explains the higher peak. **Tuesday** the average would be 7,8 ¢, and a possible 11,2 ¢ peak would fall in the morning at 07–09; this day also carries a spike risk.

**Wednesday**, **Thursday** and **Friday** are public holidays, which may lower demand and keep prices below normal. Average prices would be 6,4 ¢, 3,5 ¢ and 2,3 ¢, and daily maxima would stay around 10,7 ¢, 5,7 ¢ and 4,0 ¢. **Saturday** the average price is projected at 3,1 ¢. **Sunday** prices would remain very low: the daily average would be 0,9 ¢ with a range of 0,3–2,6 ¢. From Thursday to Friday, strong winds (averaging 4,970–5,385 MW) would support the low price level.
