The week will start on **Monday** with an average price of 7,6 ¢. Night and morning will stay near zero, but the day’s peak will likely occur around 18:00–20:00, when the price will reach about 19–20 ¢. On **Tuesday**, the level will rise clearly: the average is expected at 17,9 ¢ and the peak at 30,8 ¢. Wind power minimum output will drop to 473 MW, which explains the higher maximum price. A high risk of single-hour spikes is flagged for Tuesday, especially around 09:00–11:00 and 19:00–21:00.

By **Wednesday**, the average will ease to 11,3 ¢, but there will still be a spike risk for individual hours. The highest hourly price, 25,1 ¢, will land in the morning around 08:00–10:00. Wind power will remain weak, which can lift prices within the day and sustain wide variation.

The week’s lowest averages will fall on **Thursday** and **Sunday**. On Thursday the average is expected at 2,3 ¢ with a range of 1,3–3,4 ¢. On Sunday the average will be 2,5 ¢ with a 1,2–4,5 ¢ range. On both days wind power will be ample, which explains the low price level.

In between will be **Friday** and **Saturday**, with averages staying around 6,3–6,7 ¢. On Friday the price level will be even throughout the day. On **Saturday** a risk of single-hour spikes is flagged, even though the level will remain well below 15 ¢; the day’s most expensive window will be in the evening around 19:00–21:00 (peak 11,5 ¢). Returning to the start of the week, **Monday** night and early morning hours will hover around 0,0–0,4 ¢, which pulls down the day’s average.

Realized prices may still deviate from the forecast, especially if the wind forecast is updated.
