In the coming week, electricity price forecasts vary significantly across different days. **Tuesday** and **Wednesday** stand out with higher average prices, close to 9-10 cents per kilowatt-hour. This is partly due to low wind power production, which is expected to be below 1000 MW during some hours on Tuesday. This may increase electricity prices, particularly during peak hours in the morning and evening, when the maximum price could rise higher than predicted.

**Thursday** continues the trend, with a predicted average price of 10.0 ¬¢/kWh. Price spikes are also possible on Thursday, especially in the morning and evening. **Friday** offers some relief, as the predicted average price drops to 5.1 cents per kilowatt-hour, although individual hourly spikes are possible.

Over the weekend, on **Saturday** and **Sunday**, prices appear to stabilize, and Saturday's forecasts indicate more affordable prices, with an average price of just 3.1 ¬¢/kWh. Sunday's price expectations also remain moderate at 3.9 cents. This is partly due to more stable wind power production, exceeding 2000 MW on both days.
