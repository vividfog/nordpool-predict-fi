Average prices for the week will remain mostly low, roughly 0.8–4.5¢. Strong wind output will depress prices especially on **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, with averages at 0.8–1.1¢ and some negative hours overnight. **Thursday** will stand out, with a projected peak of 12.7¢; this is explained by a very low wind minimum (1,733 MW) that day.

**Sunday** will be a public holiday, so demand may be lower than usual. The day’s average is estimated at 3.8¢, and single-hour spike risk will focus on the morning, most likely 9–11 (day’s high 7.2¢). The cheapest moments of the week will occur from Tuesday to Thursday during night and early-morning hours, when prices occasionally dip below zero.
