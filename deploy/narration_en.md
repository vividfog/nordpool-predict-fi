The week will largely remain inexpensive: on most days, the average price will stay below four cents. Particularly low levels are expected on **Tuesday** and **Wednesday** (around 1,0–1,1 ¢), and prices may dip below zero during the small hours on multiple nights. The week’s highest single price will likely occur on **Thursday**, when the maximum reaches 14,1 ¢. That day is also marked by an exceptionally low minimum wind output (1355 MW), which likely explains the higher peak. Strong winds early in the week will keep prices down, while variability will increase towards the end of the week.

Spike risk will be emphasized on **Friday** and **Sunday**. Friday’s peak will lean towards the morning around 8–10, and weak wind (avg 2291 MW) may support a higher price. **Sunday** is a public holiday, which typically tempers demand and the average price, but a single peak may land in the late morning around 9–11; wind remains low on average (1979 MW). The cheapest moments will likely fall during nights and early mornings, especially Tue–Thu.
