During the upcoming week, electricity spot prices are expected to vary significantly across different days. **Friday** is anticipated to stand out with the highest prices, with an average electricity spot price rising to 4.2 cents per kilowatt-hour. Wind power production is expected to be relatively low on that day, partially explaining the higher price. Additionally, price spikes might occur particularly in the morning between 7-9 AM and in the evening between 7-9 PM, potentially leading to higher prices.

**Sunday**, on the other hand, is expected to have the lowest prices of the week, with an average price possibly dropping to 0.9 cents. Negative prices might also occur during some hours, especially in the late morning between 10 AM and 12 PM. This is partly due to the moderate levels of wind power production, supporting low prices.

The other days of the week fall between these extremes in terms of price levels. **Monday** and **Tuesday** are expected to have moderate prices, with potential price spikes around 8 AM and 6 PM. **Wednesday**'s prices are expected to be close to the week's average level, with no significant price fluctuations anticipated.

Overall, the forecasts suggest that electricity spot prices will vary significantly throughout the day. It is important to note that these forecasts may change if, for example, wind forecasts are updated.
