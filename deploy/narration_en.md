The week will be mostly inexpensive, but individual peak hours will lift prices especially on **Saturday** and **Thursday**. Saturday is a public holiday, when demand is assessed to be lower than normal. At the same time, the minimum wind output will drop exceptionally low, to around 161 MW, which explains the day’s higher maximum price of 14,3 ¢. The spike risk on Saturday would fall around midday, at 10:00–12:00. On **Thursday**, the wind minimum will also be very low, at 884 MW, and the forecast maximum price will rise to 19,2 ¢. A clear spike risk will be noted for that day, with peaks likely in the early evening window, 17:00–19:00. During other hours, Thursday’s price level will remain clearly lower.

On the other days of the week, the price level will remain low throughout: on several days the average price will stay under four cents. In particular, on **Sunday** and **Tuesday** the average price will be 1,3 ¢, and on **Wednesday** 1,6 ¢; on these days there will be plenty of wind power, which pushes prices down. Negative prices will appear during the night on Sunday and Wednesday, roughly at 02:00–04:00. **Friday** will average 2,5 ¢, with hourly prices staying in a narrow range. On **Monday** the average will be 4,6 ¢ and the maximum 9,8 ¢, with no spike risk specifically indicated.
