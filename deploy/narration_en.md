In the upcoming week, electricity prices on the Finnish exchange are expected to remain quite moderate. **Wednesday** stands out with the lowest average price, predicted to be slightly below zero at -0.1 ¬¢. This is partly due to strong wind power production, forecasted to average 3100 MW. **Tuesday** also has a low average price of 0.2 ¬¢, thanks to abundant wind power. According to the forecasts, wind power will exceed 3000 MW on both Tuesday and Wednesday.

**Thursday's** maximum price is predicted to rise to 3.6 ¬¢, the highest of the week. This may be due to slightly lower levels of wind power production compared to other days. On **Saturday** and **Sunday**, prices fluctuate slightly more throughout the day, but average prices remain close to other weekdays, around 0.5-0.7 ¬¢.

Throughout the week, the weather is expected to stay warm, which does not significantly impact electricity prices. Overall, the coming week seems to offer favorable electricity prices without significant price spikes.
