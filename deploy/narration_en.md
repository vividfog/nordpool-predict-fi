Over the coming days, electricity prices on the exchange will vary significantly from day to day. At the start of the forecast on **Wednesday**, the average electricity price will be clearly low, only 0.3 cents per kilowatt-hour. During nighttime hours, negative prices are even forecasted, reaching as low as -0.1 ¬¢. This is due to high wind power generation, which peaks at over 4000 MW during the night.

However, the situation will rapidly change on **Thursday**, when the average electricity price will rise significantly to 7.2 cents. High price spikes will occur in the morning and evening hours. Between 7‚Äì9 in the morning, the price will rise above 11 cents, and the highest price of the day, 15.4 ¬¢, will occur in the evening between 19‚Äì21. Thursday's price spikes are explained by exceptionally low wind power production, which will drop to as low as 408 MW in the morning.

The week's highest average price will occur on **Friday**. Then, the price forecast indicates an average of 8.4 cents, and at its highest, electricity prices are forecasted to be as high as 18 cents on Friday morning between 8‚Äì10. Again, price spikes will be caused by exceptionally low wind power production, bottoming out at only 133 MW during the night and morning hours.

Price levels will clearly decrease for the weekend. On **Saturday**, the average price will be just 2.1 cents, and even lower on **Sunday**, at 1.3 cents. Sunday will again experience negative prices in the afternoon between 13‚Äì15, dropping to -0.2 cents.

The start of next week remains relatively affordable. **Monday** will offer an average price of 1.8 cents and **Tuesday** 3.1 cents. Both days will have more moderate price fluctuations, with no significant price spikes expected compared to Thursday and Friday.
