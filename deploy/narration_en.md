Price expectations for the week will show clear variation. On **Thursday** and **Friday**, average prices will settle at 3.7–3.0 cents, with plenty of wind power available. On **Saturday**, the daily average will stay around four cents, but the afternoon will include clearly more expensive hours rising above 10¢ around 15:00–17:00. The risk of price spikes will stand out on **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**: Tuesday’s morning peak will fall around 07:00–09:00 (up to 12.5¢) and Wednesday’s afternoon around 15:00–17:00 (up to 14.4¢).

On **Sunday**, there will also be a risk of isolated spikes, with the higher hours falling in the afternoon around 15:00–17:00 (up to 10.3¢). The week’s highest daily average will land next **Monday** at 11.1 cents. Minimum wind output on Monday will drop clearly below 1,000 MW, which explains the higher maximum price than on other days (17.8¢). The peak will cluster around 17:00–19:00, and the prices of individual peak hours may materialize above the forecast. The cheapest hours of the week will dip close to one cent, especially on Friday and Saturday nights.
