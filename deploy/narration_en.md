A clear contrast will stand out: the weekend would look inexpensive, while weekdays will be notably higher. The lowest day would be Sunday, with an average price of 4,7 ¢, and hours dipping in the early morning around 02–04 to below two cents. The highest daily average would fall on Friday (14,2 ¢), followed by Tuesday (13,5 ¢) and Wednesday (13,1 ¢). Friday’s and Tuesday’s elevated peaks would be partly explained by very low minimum wind generation: 630 MW on Friday and 967 MW on Tuesday, clearly below 2000 MW.

A high spike risk is noted for Thursday, Friday, Tuesday and Wednesday. On Thursday, the peak would cluster around 08–10 in the morning. On Friday, the most notable spike would hit in the evening around 17–19, when the forecast maximum is estimated at 25,8 ¢. On Tuesday, peaks would occur in the afternoon around 16–18, and on Wednesday around 08–10 in the morning. On Saturday, prices would stay clearly lower, although individual hours may edge up a bit in the late morning.
