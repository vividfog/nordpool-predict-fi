The week’s price level will mostly be on the expensive side. Most notable is **Wednesday**, with the average rising to 14,4 cents and the day’s peak reaching 23,0 cents. Low wind supports that level: wind power’s daily average will be 862 MW and the minimum dips to 356 MW. High-price hours will cluster around the morning peak at about 08:00–10:00, and there will be a risk of individual spikes.

**Friday’s** and Tuesday’s price levels will also rise. On Friday the peak will reach 18,6 cents around 10:00–12:00, and on Tuesday 20,2 cents around 17:00–19:00; low minimum wind output (Friday 1045 MW, Tuesday 981 MW) explains the higher peaks. On Thursday, Saturday and Monday there will be a risk of individual spikes, especially on Thursday and Monday in the morning at 08:00–10:00 and on Saturday in the early evening at 18:00–20:00. The most affordable day of the week will be **Sunday**: the average stays at 5,5 cents and the range at 3,1–9,0 cents, supported by ample wind generation (avg 3328 MW).
