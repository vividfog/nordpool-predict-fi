In the coming week, market electricity prices will fluctuate widely between different days, but no significant price anomalies are expected. **On Tuesday**, price expectations are at their highest, with the day's average price rising to 7.5 Â¢/kWh. There is also a risk of price spikes on Tuesday, especially during the morning and evening hours, when prices might exceed 14 Â¢. This could be related to low wind power production during the early morning hours. **On Wednesday**, prices will decrease to an average of 5.4 Â¢/kWh, and no price spikes are expected as wind power production remains relatively high.

**On Thursday**, the average price will rise again to 6.0 Â¢/kWh, and there is a high risk of price spikes, especially in the morning hours. This is partly due to low wind power production, which falls below 1000 MW. **On Friday** and **Saturday**, prices will remain moderate, with average prices at 3.0 Â¢ and 2.8 Â¢/kWh. Sundayâ€™s average price is 2.9 Â¢/kWh, and on Monday, the price will decrease further to 2.1 Â¢/kWh.

Looking at the whole week, the price level is quite affordable, especially over the weekend and next Monday, when prices are at their lowest. Wind power production varies significantly throughout the week, partly explaining the fluctuation in prices. *Market predictions analyzed today by gpt-4o.* ðŸ“ˆ
