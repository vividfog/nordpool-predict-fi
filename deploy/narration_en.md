| **Wednesday** | 9,1 | 4,5 - 13,7 | 1756 - 3037 | -0,1 |

The start of the week looks set to be inexpensive. Strong winds will push prices down on **Thursday** and **Friday**, and negative hourly prices will be expected on Friday between 02:00–04:00 and on **Saturday** between 06:00–08:00. **Sunday’s** average would still stay under four cents, but the rise would begin on **Monday** to 6.5 cents.

**Tuesday** will stand out as the week’s most expensive day: the average would be 8.8 ¢ and the day’s peak at 15.4 ¢ would most likely occur between 09:00–11:00. Minimum wind output will fall clearly below 2000 MW (1360 MW), which explains the higher peak and underscores the spike risk. **Wednesday** is a public holiday, so demand may be lower than usual, but the forecast will still indicate spike risk; the day’s peak at 13.7 ¢ would most likely fall between 16:00–18:00. The cheapest periods will occur overnight and in the early morning from Thursday to Saturday, while the most expensive hours will cluster on Tuesday morning and early Wednesday evening.
