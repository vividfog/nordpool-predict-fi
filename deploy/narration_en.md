Electricity price forecasts for the coming days show distinct variations. Particularly on **Friday**, individual price spikes will be possible. Friday's average price will climb to 8.2 cents, and the peak hour between 18‚Äì20 is expected to reach as high as 18.6 cents. The high price will partly be explained by low wind power generation, dropping to only 224 MW at its lowest.

On **Thursday** too, electricity prices will be impacted by relatively weak wind generation, with a minimum level of just 350 MW. Thursday's highest price moments will occur between 21‚Äì23, when hourly prices may surpass 16 cents per kilowatt-hour. Despite this, Thursday's average price remains more moderate at 5.4 cents.

As the weekend approaches, prices will drop significantly. On **Saturday**, the average price will fall below four cents, even though wind power production remains relatively modest. Saturday's price peak of 8.8 ¬¢ will occur in the morning hours between 8‚Äì10. On Sunday, prices will decrease further, with an average price dropping below one cent. This day will also see negative prices in the afternoon, with electricity cheapest between 12‚Äì14, at -1.1 cents per kilowatt-hour.

Prices on Monday and Tuesday will remain moderate, though fluctuations seen earlier in the week will continue. On **Monday**, the average price will stay below two cents, with the cheapest hours early in the morning between 2‚Äì4, dropping as low as -0.9 cents. On **Tuesday**, prices will rise slightly but remain below a three-cent average. Tuesday's most expensive hours will occur in the evening between 19‚Äì21, when prices will rise above eight cents.

On **Wednesday**, prices will again become steadier. The day's average price will be 2.8 cents, and price fluctuations will remain more moderate compared to previous days. Wednesday evening's peak price will occur between 20‚Äì22, reaching 4.9 cents at its highest.
