*Next week, electricity price forecasts will fluctuate significantly, especially on Friday and Saturday when price spikes are likely. This is primarily due to variations in wind power production, which significantly affects the price trend.*

The Loviisa 2 nuclear power plant is undergoing maintenance, which began on August 17, 2025, at 04:00 and will end on September 8, 2025, at 00:00. This maintenance may impact the accuracy of the forecast, as training data is limited during maintenance periods.

The forecast was updated on **Wednesday** at 21:06.

In the week's price forecast, variability is evident. **Thursday** is the cheapest day of the week with an average price of only 1.2 ¢/kWh, and the lowest price could even be 0.0 ¢. This is explained by strong wind power production, ranging from 2115 MW to 4021 MW. On **Friday** and **Saturday**, the risk of price spikes is significant, particularly during the morning and evening hours. On Friday, prices could rise up to 15.7 cents, while Saturday is expected to reach peak prices of up to 18.2 ¢. This is partly due to a lack of wind power, especially on Saturday, when minimum production is only 308 MW.

**Sunday** sees the average price drop to 5.0 cents, with price fluctuations remaining more moderate. On **Monday** and **Tuesday**, price trends are more stable, but on Tuesday, price spikes could reach 15.5 ¢. **Wednesday** sees prices stabilize again, with an average price of 2.7 ¢, making it the second cheapest day of the week.
