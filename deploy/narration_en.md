The upcoming week's price forecasts indicate relatively stable price developments without significant anomalies. On **Sunday**, price spikes are possible, especially in the evening when the maximum price rises above 10 cents. Wind power will be lower at that time, which may influence price increases. This differentiates it from other days of the week, where prices are expected to remain at more moderate levels.

**Monday** and **Tuesday** are expected to have average electricity prices around three and a half cents. Wind power production is relatively stable on these days, without significant changes anticipated. The average prices on these days are typical, indicating a stable market situation.

On Wednesday, prices are expected to be similar to Tuesday, but there is a possibility of price spikes. Higher prices may occur in the evening when wind power production decreases. This makes Wednesday stand out due to slightly higher prices and price fluctuations.

On Thursday and Friday, price developments are expected to be very similar. Wind power production remains at a sufficient level, and significant price variations are not anticipated. As the weekend approaches, particularly on Friday, energy prices remain steady, keeping the average price slightly above three cents.

**Saturday** is expected to have the week's lowest prices. Wind power production will be the highest of the week, which partly explains the low prices. Saturday's average price is just over two cents, and the intra-day price differences are small.
