The week’s price profile will be split. **Thursday’s** and **Friday’s** average prices will climb above 15 ¢, while the week’s lowest average will land on Sunday at 5,3 ¢. Saturday will drop clearly below the early‑week levels. Friday’s rise will be explained by a very low minimum wind output, only 487 MW, which will coincide with the week’s highest maximum price, 26,8 ¢. Sunday’s broad wind generation, in turn, will show up as lower levels. Early next week, Monday will stay moderate, but on Tuesday and Wednesday the averages will climb again above 14 ¢.

Spike risk will be highlighted on individual hours especially on Friday, Tuesday and Wednesday. Friday’s peaks will be expected at 18:00–20:00 (centered around 19:00). On Tuesday the highest hour would fall at 16:00–18:00 (around 17:00), and on Wednesday at 17:00–19:00 (around 18:00). On Monday the risk will target the morning, 08:00–10:00. On Saturday any possible spikes will remain modest and cluster around midnight, 23:00–01:00. Sunday will look even, with no spike mention.
