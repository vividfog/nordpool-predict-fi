| **Monday** | 10,1 | 3,7 - 15,7 | 812 - 1499 | 2,2 |
| **Tuesday** | 9,0 | 4,3 - 13,3 | 1075 - 2926 | 1,5 |
| **Wednesday** | 7,5 | 3,7 - 13,3 | 2072 - 3553 | -0,1 |
| **Thursday** | 4,6 | 2,5 - 6,9 | 3474 - 5429 | -0,2 |
| **Friday** | 2,2 | 0,9 - 3,4 | 3973 - 5956 | 1,3 |
| **Saturday** | 1,2 | -0,1 - 2,9 | 5398 - 6104 | 1,2 |
| **Sunday** | 2,9 | 0,3 - 5,2 | 1761 - 3646 | 2,9 |

The week will start at clearly higher prices. **Monday’s** average price is expected at 10.1 ¢ and the risk of intraday spikes will be high: the peak would land around 17:00–19:00, up to 15.7 ¢. The lowest wind output (min 812 MW) is exceptionally low and explains the higher peak. **Tuesday** will remain elevated (avg 9.0 ¢) and spike risk is also anticipated for individual hours; the day’s most expensive moments will cluster in the evening around 17:00–19:00, up to 13.3 ¢. Low wind on both days supports the higher prices.

Midweek, price pressure is expected to ease. **Wednesday**, **Thursday** and **Friday** are public holidays, which can reduce demand and support lower prices. From Thursday onwards, wind power will be plentiful (over 3000 MW), which likely explains the cheaper level; Friday’s average settles at 2.2 ¢. **Saturday** will be very low (avg 1.2 ¢), and a short dip below zero is expected at night: around 02:00–04:00 the lowest price will be -0.1 ¢. The most affordable stretch of the week will fall from Thursday to Saturday, whereas the week’s highest single price will arrive on Monday evening.
