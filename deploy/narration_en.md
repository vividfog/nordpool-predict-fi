*Next week, electricity prices will vary significantly on different days, with a high risk of price spikes at the beginning of the week. The weekend, however, offers a chance to enjoy lower costs thanks to strong wind power.*

Scheduled maintenance at the Loviisa nuclear power plants may impact the accuracy of next week's electricity price forecasts. **Loviisa 1** has been offline since September 6, 2025, and is expected to return to production on September 24, 2025. **Loviisa 2** started its maintenance outage on August 17, 2025, and will return to production on September 13, 2025. Due to limited data available during these outages, these interruptions may affect the accuracy of the forecasts.

Forecast updated: Sunday at 14:25.

The coming week is expected to bring significant fluctuations in electricity prices. **Monday** shows high price expectations, with the day's peak price potentially reaching 37.6 cents. This could be attributed to low wind power production, dropping to as low as 327 MW. **Tuesday** still anticipates high prices, with a risk of price spikes, particularly during morning and evening hours.

**Wednesday** sees a significant drop in average electricity prices to 4.5 cents, but individual hourly price spikes could surprise, as the maximum price is forecasted at 16.8 cents. Thursday and Friday are expected to be much cheaper, with prices staying close to zero. Strong wind power on both days could explain the low prices.

**Saturday** is forecasted to be the cheapest day of the week, with a negative average price. On Sunday, prices rise slightly, and the risk of price spikes exists. This could result from a decrease in wind power production throughout Sunday.

The week's price developments are therefore highly variable, and electricity users can expect particularly high prices at the beginning of the week. The weekend, on the other hand, offers the possibility of lower costs if wind power forecasts hold true. *This week's forecast interpreted by gpt-4o.* üå¨Ô∏è
