Electricity price forecasts for the coming week will show significant daily fluctuations. The most affordable day will be **Saturday**, with an average electricity price of just 1.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. The cheapest hours on Saturday will occur early in the morning around 4 AM, when the price will drop as low as 0.1 cents. Although Saturday's average price will be very affordable, there may be brief price spikes reaching up to 2.7 cents, particularly in the early evening between 5 and 7 PM.

The week's other weekend day, **Sunday**, will also offer a moderate average price of 2.3 cents. However, Sunday's price fluctuations will be greater than on Saturday: early morning hours will approach near-zero levels, but evening prices from 7 to 9 PM will rise above five cents, peaking at 5.3 cents. Sunday too carries a risk of temporary price spikes during individual hours.

As the workweek begins, electricity prices will rise notably compared to the weekend. On **Monday**, the average price will climb to 5.1 cents, with a maximum price near eight cents. Price spikes may particularly occur in the morning from 7 to 9 AM and in the evening between 7 and 9 PM, when the price will peak around 7.8 cents.

**Wednesday** appears as the week's most expensive day, with an average price of 5.7 cents. The day's highest price will be reached in the morning between 8 and 10 AM, when electricity prices are expected to rise as high as 9.3 cents. On Wednesday, individual hourly prices may exceed forecasts.

Tuesday and Thursday will settle near Monday's price levels, both having an average price around five cents. Price variation on these days will also be significant, but the forecast does not specifically mention notable risks for higher price spikes.

Throughout the week, electricity prices will vary considerably between days and different times of day. From the consumer's point of view, weekend hours will clearly be the most affordable, whereas weekday mornings and evenings will bring occasionally higher price levels.
