| **Saturday** | 6,1 | 3,9 - 10,9 | 1931 - 2795 | 5,2 |

The week is expected to split into two. Prices will start moderate, and especially on **Monday** the average is forecast to remain at 3,9 cents. The clear outlier will be on **Tuesday**, when the average rises to 16,9 ¢ and the highest hourly price reaches 29,6 ¢. Toward the end of the week the level will even out again: on **Thursday** the average is 2,3 ¢ and on **Sunday** 2,1 ¢, with small intraday variation.

On **Tuesday** isolated price spikes will be at risk. The highest window of the day will fall in the late morning, 9–11, and another pronounced window will appear in the early evening, 18–20. Very low minimum wind output, 487 MW, explains the day’s higher maximum compared with other days.

On **Wednesday** the price risk will concentrate in the morning hours 8–10, when a maximum of 24,6 ¢ is forecast. Wind will stay at a generally low level (1446 MW), which supports higher prices compared with the week’s cheaper days.

On **Thursday** prices will stay low and variation will be small. The week will continue on **Friday** with the average moving to around six cents, and on **Saturday** there will be a risk of isolated elevated hours, especially in the evening 19–21; the day’s highest price is forecast at 10,9 ¢. On **Sunday** the inexpensive level will continue, and wind will be plentiful.

The cheapest hours will concentrate in the small hours early in the week: **Monday’s** 0–5 window will mostly see 0,1–0,5 ¢. At the end of the week, **Sunday evening** 20–22 will also show low values, around 0,9–1,2 ¢. The highest moments will cluster in Tuesday’s and Wednesday’s mornings as well as Tuesday’s and Saturday’s evenings.
