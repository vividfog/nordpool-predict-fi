The upcoming week appears relatively stable in terms of electricity prices, with average prices mostly ranging between 2.2 and 4.0 cents. **Sunday** is expected to be the cheapest day of the week in terms of average price, but the evening may see higher price hours, up to 8.6 cents. **Tuesday** stands out with a slightly higher average and maximum price, exceeding 10 cents. This may be due to fluctuating wind power production throughout the day.

**Wednesday** and **Thursday** present moderate price developments, but both days may experience individual price spikes during the afternoon and evening hours. **Friday** brings the price level slightly lower, with variability expected throughout the day, but no significant spikes.

During the weekend, especially on **Saturday**, the average price remains low, though slightly higher prices may occur in the evening. Overall, the upcoming week offers reasonable price levels for electricity users without major surprises.
