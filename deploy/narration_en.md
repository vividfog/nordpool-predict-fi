The weekly price curve will fluctuate markedly. The highest levels will come on **Wednesday**: the day’s average will be 11,3 ¢ and the maximum 17,6 ¢, peaking in the evening around 17:00–19:00. The high max will be explained by a very low wind power minimum (241 MW), well below 2,000 MW. **Thursday** and **Friday** will average 7,3 ¢ and 6,8 ¢, yet individual hours will still climb above 14 ¢. **Saturday** being a public holiday will support low prices, pulling the average down to 2,6 ¢.

The cheapest days will fall on **Sunday** and **Tuesday**, with averages at 1,0 ¢ and 1,4 ¢. In the early hours of Sunday, prices will briefly dip below zero, roughly 02:00–04:00. **Monday** will sit in between at about 4,2 ¢. The risk of hourly price spikes will stand out on Thursday morning around 08:00–10:00 and on Friday evening around 17:00–19:00. On Saturday the spike risk will center near midday (about 10:00–12:00), even as the day-level stays low. Strong winds on Sunday and Tuesday will support the low pricing.
