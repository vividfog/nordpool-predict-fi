Price swings will be most pronounced on weekdays. On **Tuesday**, the day’s peak hours will likely cluster around 08:00–10:00, when the forecast reaches 27,6 cents. On **Wednesday**, 08:00–10:00 will also rise to about 19–20 cents, and on **Friday** the highest hours will likely land around 17:00–19:00, when the forecast reaches 20,7 cents. A high risk of price spikes is flagged for every day, so actual single-hour prices may deviate clearly from the daily average.
