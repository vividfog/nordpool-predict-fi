The week's forecast shows significant variations in expected electricity prices on different days. **Wednesday** is forecasted to have an average price of 4.5 ¢/kWh, which is relatively affordable. Thursday's forecast shows a slightly higher average price of 5.1 ¢/kWh, but the highest predicted price for the day rises to 10.7 cents, which is the highest maximum price of the week. This may be related to Thursday's low wind power production, averaging 2605 MW.

**Friday** is predicted to have significantly lower prices, with an average price of only 2.8 ¢/kWh. This is partly due to the usual level of wind power, which does not have a particular impact on the price. Weekend forecasts show even cheaper prices, with average prices of 1.9 ¢/kWh on **Saturday** and 1.4 ¢/kWh on **Sunday**. Sunday's low price is partly explained by strong wind power, which rises to as much as 4654 MW.

Next Monday, the average price rises slightly to 2.7 ¢/kWh, but Tuesday's predicted prices rise significantly higher, with an average price of 6.4 ¢/kWh. Tuesday's maximum price is 13.2 cents, which may be due to relatively weak wind power production during the day.
