Electricity prices are expected to fluctuate fairly steadily in the coming week. **On Wednesday**, prices are expected to be at their highest in the evening, with the maximum price rising to 9.1 cents. Prices are expected to remain mostly below four cents throughout the week. **On Thursday** and **Tuesday**, the average price is slightly higher, around 3.5 ¬¢/kWh, reflecting the expected lower level of wind power production.

**On Friday**, electricity prices are forecasted to be lower, with an average price of 2.9 ¬¢/kWh. Wind power production is expected to be higher then, which may partly explain the price drop. **On Saturday** and **Sunday**, prices are forecasted to be lower, with average prices at 2.2 and 1.8 cents, respectively.

**Monday** may bring slightly higher prices, especially in the evening when the maximum price could rise to 8.4 cents. The weekend appears to be a more affordable time for prices, which may encourage consumers to schedule their electricity use for these days.
