The upcoming week offers a diverse outlook on electricity price trends. **Tuesday** is expected to see significant fluctuations, with prices ranging from 0.4 to 19.5 cents. This day stands out with a high average price of 7.1 cents, and the risk of price spikes is high, particularly in the evening hours. The average wind power production is low, partly explaining the higher price levels.

On **Wednesday**, price expectations increase further, with an average price of 10.6 cents and peaks reaching up to 20.5 cents. Wind power production remains relatively low, which may elevate prices, especially in the afternoon and evening.

For the rest of the week, price trends appear more moderate. **Thursday** sees an increase in wind power production, lowering the average price to 4.6 cents. On Friday and over the weekend, prices decrease further, with particularly low prices expected on **Saturday** and **Sunday**, averaging just 0.2 cents. Wind power supply remains strong, supporting the low prices.

By next **Monday**, prices will rise slightly but will remain relatively low, with an average price of 2.5 cents. The increase in wind power production forecasts continued reasonable price trends.
