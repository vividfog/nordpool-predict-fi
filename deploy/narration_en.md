The week’s price level will fluctuate clearly. Early on there will be a distinctly higher day; midweek will shift to low averages, and later in the week evening peaks will return. The lowest daily averages will come on Tuesday and Wednesday, at 3,3 and 2,4 cents. The highest daily average will land on Friday, at 10,9 cents, and the same day’s maximum is forecast at 21,9 ¢.

**Friday’s** price peaks will concentrate around midday. The most expensive hours will fall between 10–12, with the top around 11. Wind power’s minimum output will drop exceptionally low, to 610 MW, which clearly explains the higher intraday maximum. Within the day, prices will swing widely as the morning quickly rises above 15 cents.

**Saturday** will carry an elevated risk of single-hour spikes. The highest values are forecast for the morning, 8–10, topping at 14,0 cents. The day’s minimum wind will dip to 823 MW, which may accentuate the morning’s hour-to-hour variation. **Monday** will also feature spike risk around midday: 12–14 is forecast to host the daily high near 13,1 ¢. The minimum wind will reach 1331 MW, so a few midday hours may stand out as pricier than the surrounding levels.

The cheapest moments will arrive on **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**. Several night-time hours will sink below one cent (Tue 2–4, Wed 2–4). On these two days, wind power is forecast to be abundant, averaging over 4 GW, which supports a low price level throughout the day.

At the end of the week, on **Thursday**, an evening peak will lift the profile. The priciest hours will fall between 18–20, and the daily maximum is forecast at 16,0 ¢. The minimum wind will be 1476 MW, and the risk of single-hour spikes will be clearly elevated. Otherwise the daily average will remain under seven cents, with cheaper hours appearing in the small hours.
