As the week progresses, significant fluctuations occur in electricity prices. **Tuesday** starts the week as the most affordable day, with an average price of 1.5 Â¢. This is partly due to strong wind power, which keeps prices low. **Wednesday's** average price rises to 5.2 Â¢, but the risk of price spikes is minimal. **Thursday** sees an average price of 6.0 Â¢, and there is a potential for individual price spikes, especially during morning and evening hours when wind power may be low.

**Friday's** average price is set at 5.6 Â¢, and individual price spikes are also possible. **Saturday** sees a peak in price development, with an average price rising to 14.0 Â¢ and a maximum price reaching 26.5 Â¢, predicting significant price spikes, particularly in the early morning hours. This is due to the lack of wind power, which increases price volatility.

**Sunday's** price expectations decrease slightly, but the risk of price spikes remains high. **Monday** sees prices stabilizing, with an average price forecasted at 4.1 Â¢, making it the second most affordable day of the week.
