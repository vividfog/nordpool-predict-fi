Prices will vary notably through the week. The highest average will land on **Friday** (14,6 ¢), alongside the week’s top hourly price at 24,3 ¢. This is explained by an exceptionally low minimum wind output of 482 MW. On **Thursday** and **Tuesday**, averages will also stay elevated at 12,1 ¢ and 11,3 ¢. **Saturday** is a public holiday, which is expected to push prices lower: the daily average will be 5,8 ¢ with a range of 4,3–7,2 ¢. On **Sunday** and **Wednesday**, prices will remain moderate, partly supported by strong wind (averaging 3 203 MW on Sunday and 3 080 MW on Wednesday).

Spike risk will be pronounced on **Friday**: the most expensive hours will likely fall around 17–19 and late morning 10–12, and individual peaks could exceed the forecast. On **Tuesday** the risk will also be high, with spikes centered at 10–12 and 8–10; peaks may likewise surpass the projection. On **Monday**, a spike may appear in the evening around 17–19. On **Saturday**, isolated upticks may occur around midday, about 11–13, even if the overall level remains low. The cheapest periods will cluster overnight: in the night leading into **Thursday** at 00–02 and early Saturday at 03–05, prices will drop clearly below the daily average.
