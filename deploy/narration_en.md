A two-track development will be expected in the power market next week. On **Sunday** it will be a holiday, so demand will likely stay low and the price will remain between 1,9–5,8 ¢; the average will be projected at 3,5 ¢. On **Monday** and **Tuesday** the level will rise clearly: averages at 11,1–11,4 ¢ and maxima at 18,8–19,7 ¢. Behind this will be weaker wind in the early week. From **Wednesday** to **Saturday** prices will return to a cheaper range, with averages between 1,9–3,8 ¢ and clearly narrower ranges.

Spike risk will be confined to the early week. On **Monday** the most expensive hours will be estimated at 17–19, and on **Tuesday** a morning peak at 8–10. On both days minimum wind output will drop below 1000 MW (Mon 774 MW, Tue 826 MW), which explains the higher peaks and why individual hours may stand out. Later in the week, abundant wind, on average above 3000 MW, will support a low price level. The cheapest electricity will be expected on **Saturday**: an average of 1,9 ¢ and a range of 0,4–3,3 ¢. In addition, on **Thursday** and **Friday** nights very low prices will appear around 2–4.
