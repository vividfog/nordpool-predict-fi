The clearest jump of the week is seen in **Friday’s** price outlook. The average price is 14,4 ¢ and the peak 24,1 ¢. Single-hour spike risk is elevated especially at 16:00–18:00, and a very low wind power minimum (335 MW) explains the high peak. **Saturday** will be a public holiday, and the average price stays at 6,2 cents; spike risk is concentrated in the morning around 08:00–10:00. **Tuesday’s** average is 11,3 ¢ and the peak 19,8 ¢; spike risk falls in the morning at 08:00–10:00, which weak wind (min 781 MW) may influence. On **Thursday** the average rises to 9,5 ¢ and the peak to 15,2 ¢, and spike risk is in the evening at 17:00–19:00.

On **Sunday** and **Wednesday** the price level remains moderate as wind power is plentiful. Sunday’s average is estimated at 6,3 ¢ and Wednesday’s at 7,2 ¢. On **Monday** the figures are higher: average 9,0 ¢ and peak 13,1 ¢. The week’s cheapest periods will fall at night and in the early morning, especially over the weekend, when the price dips several times below 4–6 cents. Overall, prices vary clearly from day to day: weak wind lifts early- and late-week numbers, while strong wind pushes them lower midweek.
