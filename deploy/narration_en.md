During the upcoming week, electricity prices on the exchange will show significant fluctuations. Average daily prices will range from less than one cent to slightly over five cents per kilowatt-hour. Overall, the week's price level remains fairly affordable, although certain days will experience clear peak hours.

The highest prices of the week will occur on **Wednesday**, with an average price of 5.1 cents. Peak prices‚Äînearly nine cents‚Äîwill take place in the evening from 20:00 to 22:00. During these hours, prices will remain clearly higher than on other days of the week. Wednesday's price increase is partly explained by very low wind power production, dropping to just over a hundred megawatts at its lowest.

On **Thursday**, the price will decrease from the previous day, settling at an average of 3.5 cents. On Thursday evening, an exceptional situation will occur as electricity prices turn negative between 22:00 and 24:00. This is due to strong winds driving wind power production to nearly 5000 megawatts.

The cheapest electricity will be available on **Friday**, with a daily average of merely 0.1 cents. On Friday night, the price dips below zero, reaching the week's lowest level of -1.4 cents between 04:00 and 05:00. Abundant wind power availability contributes significantly to these very low prices. During the weekend, on **Saturday** and **Sunday**, prices remain moderate, averaging around one cent. However, both days carry a risk of isolated price spikes during certain hours.

Early next week, on **Monday** and **Tuesday**, prices will rise moderately from weekend levels. Monday evening will again experience a higher peak price‚Äînearly nine cents‚Äîbetween 19:00 and 21:00. On Tuesday, prices stabilize further, with no significant risk of price spikes.
