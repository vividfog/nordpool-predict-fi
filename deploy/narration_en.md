Weekly price levels will mostly be typical, at times on the cheaper side. The lowest levels are expected especially on **Sunday** (avg 3,6 ¢), and on **Monday** the average will also stay at 4,2 cents. The highest daily average will be seen on **Friday** (6,9 ¢), and the week’s largest hourly price also falls on Friday, 14,2 ¢. Friday’s minimum wind output will remain at 1386 megawatts, which explains the higher maximum price compared with the rest of the week. On **Saturday** the average will be almost the same (6,8 ¢) and the top hour 13,7 ¢.

The risk of price spikes will stand out in three cases. On **Wednesday**, a morning peak will fall at 07–09, when the highest forecast hour is 10,5 ¢. On **Thursday**, an evening bump will occur at 18–20, with the upper bound at 8,2 ¢. On **Saturday**, the most exposed window will be in the morning at 07–09, with a 13,7 ¢ peak in the middle. The cheapest hours later in the week will cluster overnight and in the early morning, especially on Sunday.
