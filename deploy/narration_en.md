On Thursday and Friday, the expected average electricity price will rise slightly, averaging 6.5 cents on Thursday and 8.1 cents per kilowatt-hour on Friday. Both days will experience significant hourly price variability. Thursday's peak, exceeding 15 cents, is expected around nine in the evening (between 20:00–22:00). Wind power production remains very low on Thursday and Friday, partially explaining the high maximum prices and creating a risk for price spikes, particularly on Friday between 18:00–20:00.

During the weekend, prices will considerably decrease. On **Saturday**, average prices will settle around four cents, but hourly variations remain large, ranging from 0.7 to 9.0 cents. Prices on Saturday morning will stay elevated, but during the afternoon between 14:00–16:00, electricity prices will drop significantly to below two cents. **Sunday** will be the week's most affordable day, with average prices as low as 1.3 cents. There will be minimal variation throughout the day, with prices consistently below three cents.

Early next week will remain affordable, with Monday and Tuesday's average electricity prices staying below two cents. Both days will have occasional negative hourly prices. On Monday, the lowest price, -0.6 cents, will occur immediately after midnight between 00:00–02:00. On Tuesday, negative pricing will again appear in the early morning hours (03:00–05:00), with the lowest being -0.6 cents.

On **Wednesday**, prices slightly rise again, averaging 2.7 cents. However, prices will remain moderate throughout the day, with minimal hourly variations and a maximum price of five cents.

Throughout the week, notable price fluctuations will occur particularly on Thursday and Friday, when low wind-power production increases the risk of price spikes early in the morning and in the evening. The weekend and early next week, however, offer significantly cheaper electricity prices, including negative hourly prices during nighttime hours.
