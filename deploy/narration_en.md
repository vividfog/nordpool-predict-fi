In the coming week, electricity price expectations are varied. The **Thursday** average price is expected to be around 5.9 cents per kilowatt-hour, with prices ranging from one to 14.4 cents throughout the day. Wind power production is moderate and is not expected to significantly affect prices.

**Friday's** predicted prices are affordable, with an average price of only 3.1¢/kWh. The day's prices range between 0.4 and 7.2 cents, making it one of the cheapest days of the week. Ample wind power partly explains the low prices.

**Saturday** and **Sunday** continue the trend of low prices, with both days having an average price of 1.4 cents. On both days, prices remain low, largely due to strong wind power supporting the affordable price level.

Next **Monday**, price expectations rise slightly compared to previous days, with an average price of 3.7 cents per kilowatt-hour. On Tuesday, prices increase further, with an expected average price of 6.7 cents. Wind power production is expected to be at its lowest at 1874 MW on Tuesday, which explains the higher price level.

**Wednesday** sees a significant rise in electricity prices, with an average price forecasted at 11.2 cents. The day's maximum price could reach up to 22.2 cents, making Wednesday the most expensive day of the week. Wind power production is low on Wednesday, which partly contributes to the high price level. Additionally, there is a high risk of price spikes on Wednesday, particularly between 18:00 and 20:00.
