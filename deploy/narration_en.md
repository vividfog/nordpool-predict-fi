The week’s price level will split in two: the cheapest days will fall at the end of the week, while early next week prices will rise clearly. On **Friday** and **Saturday**, hourly prices will mostly stay below four cents and dip below zero in places overnight. Strong wind will support low prices on these days. On **Sunday**, the average price will increase, and the evening will see the day’s most expensive hours.

The upward phase will continue at the start of the week. On **Tuesday**, the average will climb to 10.5 ¢ and the day’s peak to 20.1 ¢, roughly around 16:00–18:00. Wind production will bottom out unusually low then (below 1000 MW), which explains the high peak. On **Wednesday**, prices will remain even higher than Tuesday: the average will be 12.2 ¢ and the peak 20.7 ¢, most likely around 08:00–10:00. Wind minimum will also stay clearly below 2000 MW, which will contribute to the peaks. On **Thursday**, individual spikes may occur in the morning around 08:00–10:00, even though the forecast maximum stays at 14.0 ¢.
