The Olkiluoto nuclear power plants currently have production limitations. Olkiluoto 2 is on a maintenance outage from 25.5.2025 at 18:00 to 24.6.2025 at 18:00. Olkiluoto 3's available capacity is restricted to 1060 megawatts from its normal 1600 megawatts between 23.6.2025 at 06:00 and 26.6.2025 at 01:00. The maintenance outage and production restriction could affect forecast accuracy, as training data from similar situations is limited.

Electricity market prices will fluctuate significantly in the coming days. Prices will be very affordable on **Wednesday**, with an average daily price of only half a cent. Negative hourly prices will also occur on Wednesday during nighttime and early afternoon. The lowest hourly price is forecast to be -0,6 cents between 04:00 and 06:00.

However, the price level will rise substantially starting on **Thursday** and **Friday**, when the daily average prices will exceed seven cents and approach seven cents, respectively. Thursdayâ€™s prices will peak notably during morning and evening, reaching up to 15 cents during evening hours between 20:00 and 22:00. Friday's highest hourly price, as much as 18,2 cents, occurs in the morning between 08:00 and 10:00. Both days carry a high risk of brief price spikes at individual hours. This sharp price increase is primarily explained by very low wind power production minimums, clearly below a thousand megawatts on both days.

As the weekend begins, prices will again drop to moderate levels. The average prices on **Saturday** and **Sunday** remain slightly above two cents. On Saturday, a few negative prices will appear in the afternoon, with the lowest at -0,2 cents between 15:00 and 16:00. Although weekend prices will mainly remain moderate, isolated hourly price spikes could still occur.

At the start of next **week**, prices will remain at affordable levels. **Mondayâ€™s** daily average price is 3,7 cents, with a peak of 6,8 cents late morning between 09:00 and 11:00. On **Tuesday**, average prices stay nearly at the same level, at 3,5 cents, with the dayâ€™s maximum price remaining below seven cents. However, the possibility of individual price spikes exists on both days.

The coming week's price trend is characterized by significant variation, with Thursday and Friday standing out as more expensive days. Wednesday and weekend days, on the other hand, will clearly be cheaper, providing consumers opportunities for more affordable electricity usage during these periods.
