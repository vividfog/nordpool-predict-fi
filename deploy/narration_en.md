The electricity price forecast for the upcoming week shows variable trends, with particular attention on **Monday**. Monday is expected to have the highest average price of the week, at 4.8 cents, with a maximum price forecasted at up to 11.7¬¢. This may partly be explained by the low minimum wind power production, predicted to be at 625 MW. There is also a high risk of price spikes on **Monday**, especially during the morning and afternoon hours, between 8-10 AM and 6-8 PM.

**Tuesday** sees prices stabilizing somewhat, but the maximum price still rises to 8.4¬¢, and the risk of price spikes remains. **Sunday** also stands out slightly, as despite the low average price, there is a risk of price spikes. Price expectations on Sunday range from 0.5¬¢ to 5.7¬¢.

The cheapest days of the week appear to be **Thursday** and **Wednesday**, when the average electricity price drops to around 2 cents. On these days, wind power production is at a higher level, which contributes to more affordable prices. On Thursday, wind power production can rise up to 3083 MW.

Overall, electricity prices next week will vary significantly, and consumers should pay attention to the price fluctuations on specific days and hours.
