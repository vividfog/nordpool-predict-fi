The electricity markets are expected to fluctuate moderately next week. **Tuesday** stands out with a higher average price of 12.0 ¬¢/kWh, with the day's maximum price reaching up to 22.6 ¬¢. This is partly due to low wind power production, forecasted to be as low as 483 MW, which may lead to price spikes particularly in the evening, around 19:00-21:00. **On Wednesday**, the average price drops to 9.1 ¬¢/kWh, but the risk of price spikes remains. Wind power production varies significantly, which can influence the day's price fluctuations.

**Thursday** sees further price reductions, with an average price of 6.9 ¬¢/kWh. Wind power production increases significantly, which might help keep prices in check, but individual price spikes during the day are still a risk. The latter part of the week, from **Friday to Sunday**, appears to remain quite affordable, with average prices around 2.9 - 4.8 ¬¢/kWh. During these days, wind power production is more consistent and higher, helping to keep prices low.

**Next Monday**, the price forecast remains reasonable with an average price of 4.7 ¬¢/kWh. Wind power stays at a high level throughout the day, which might stabilize the price development. Overall, the electricity price trends for next week show fluctuations especially at the beginning of the week, but prices level off and remain low towards the weekend.
