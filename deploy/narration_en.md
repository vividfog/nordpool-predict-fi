The upcoming week shows fluctuating electricity prices. **Saturday** and **Sunday** offer affordable rates, with averages even dipping into negative values, meaning practically free electricity for users. This is partly due to strong wind power production exceeding 3000 MW.

**Monday** is expected to see a rise in prices, with the average price forecasted to reach 5.0 cents. Price spikes might occur during the day, especially around 8 AM and 6 PM. This is partly due to weaker wind power production, averaging 2401 MW.

On **Tuesday**, the average electricity price rises further to 7.6¬¢, with potential for price spikes during the day. The wind power production is forecasted to be even lower than on Monday, partly explaining the higher prices.

**Wednesday** will be a significant day in terms of prices, with maximum prices potentially reaching 17.8¬¢. Therefore, there is a high risk of price spikes on Wednesday, particularly in the morning and evening.

Prices decrease slightly on **Thursday** compared to Wednesday. The average price is forecasted at 4.8¬¢, and wind power production remains close to normal levels. While there is still a risk of price spikes, it is lower than on Wednesday.

As the week closes on **Friday**, prices remain moderate, with an average price of 2.2¬¢. Wind power production is forecasted to rise back to higher levels, helping to keep prices low.
