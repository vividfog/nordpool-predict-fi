In individual peak hours, attention will focus especially on early next week. On next **Monday**, prices are expected to peak at 16.9 cents, and the risk of hourly price spikes will be high. In the hourly forecast, the most expensive period will fall between 08:00 and 10:00. On next **Tuesday**, the ceiling rises higher still, to 18.8 cents, and the risk of price spikes will also be high then. The most expensive period will be between 17:00 and 19:00. A risk of hourly price spikes will also appear in the forecast for next **Sunday** and **Wednesday**, and on Wednesday the day’s most expensive period will fall between 09:00 and 11:00. Tuesday is a public holiday, and energy demand may be lower than normal, which could push the price down.
