The price outlook for electricity on the power exchange will be variable over the coming days. Clearly higher prices will be observed at the beginning of the forecast period, whereas the weekend and the start of next week will bring cheaper periods with lower prices.

The week's highest price levels are forecasted for Thursday and Friday. **Thursday's** expected price peak will occur in the evening between 19–21, when electricity prices may reach up to 16 cents per kilowatt-hour. Within the same day, prices will fluctuate considerably, with electricity dropping as low as 0.3 cents during night hours from 00–02. **Friday** will also experience significant price variations during the day, with the highest price (around 14.5 cents) expected in the evening hours between 19–21.

Electricity prices will become noticeably more affordable during the weekend. **Saturday** and **Sunday** average prices will decline well below five cents. Negative prices are even predicted during the night hours leading into Sunday. The lowest expected electricity price is -0.1 cents between 23–01 on Sunday.

This affordable pricing will continue into early next week. On **Monday**, the average electricity price will remain low, around 1.5 cents. Negative prices will again appear at night between 00–02, dropping as low as -0.6 cents. Prices on Tuesday and Wednesday will rise slightly, yet remain moderate, averaging around three cents.

The highest prices on Thursday and Friday will be partly explained by exceptionally low wind power production. On both days, wind power production will occasionally drop to unusually low levels, increasing the risk of price spikes. Particularly on Thursday, wind power generation will dip as low as approximately 400 megawatts, elevating the risk of price spikes during evening hours.

Price fluctuations this week will be particularly pronounced between the beginning of the forecast period and the weekend. Consumers should prepare for noticeably higher prices on Thursday and Friday, whereas weekend and early next week's forecasts promise significantly cheaper kilowatt-hours.
