Price levels will vary clearly over the week. The most distinctive day will be **Tuesday**, with the average price rising to 24,8 cents and the daily high reaching 57,2 cents. In the evening at 18:00–20:00 the price is expected to peak. Exceptionally low minimum wind output (510 MW) explains the elevated highs, and the day’s average wind will also remain weak.

**On Wednesday**, prices will drop notably, with the average at 12,0 ¢ and the upper bound at 23,7 ¢. The forecast highlights an elevated risk of single-hour spikes, with the peak most likely at 08:00–10:00. Within the day, wind varies strongly: the minimum is only 694 MW, which supports higher-priced morning hours. In the evening, prices will sink toward a few cents.

**On Thursday**, the trough deepens: the average settles at 1,5 cents and most hours stay very low. Abundant wind generation, clearly above 3000 MW through the day, underpins the levels. **On Friday** and **on Sunday**, averages will remain low (4,0 ¢ and 3,0 ¢) with limited variation. **On Saturday**, a slightly higher level will be seen, yet the ceiling stays below 10 cents, and intraday swings remain moderate.

Next **Monday**, prices will move closer to weekday norms, with an average of 9,5 ¢ and an upper bound of 16,1 ¢. The forecast stresses a heightened single-hour spike risk, with the critical window at 14:00–16:00. The driver is a low wind minimum (838 MW), which combined with the afternoon demand peak lifts the high.

In short, the week will look like this: Tuesday will turn exceptionally expensive due to weak wind, spike risks stand out on Wednesday and next Monday, and from Thursday to Sunday prices will mostly stay at a few cents thanks to strong winds.
