**Wednesday** is expected to have the highest average price of the week, at 6.6 Â¢/kWh, making it an exceptionally expensive day. The maximum price could rise to as much as 17.4 cents. This is partly due to the low minimum wind power production, which is just 633 megawatts on Wednesday. Significant price spikes are expected during the late morning hours, particularly between 10 AM and 12 PM, when wind power is scarce and electricity demand is high.

**Thursday** sees a significant drop in prices, with an expected average price of 0.6 Â¢/kWh, making it the cheapest day of the week. Strong wind power production partly explains the low price. No price spikes are anticipated.

**Friday** is also a cheap day, with an average price of 1.2 Â¢/kWh. Wind power production remains high, keeping prices low. The highest prices occur in the evening, when the maximum price rises to 4.4 cents.

**Saturday** prices remain low, with an average price of 0.5 Â¢/kWh. However, there is significant intra-day price variation, as prices can range from -1.5 cents to 5 cents. This is particularly due to fluctuating wind power production.

**Sunday** is forecasted to have a 1.9 Â¢/kWh average price, with prices expected to rise towards the evening. The highest maximum price of 6.2 cents is anticipated between 6 PM and 8 PM, when wind power production is at its lowest.

**Monday** continues the trend of low prices, with an average price of 0.8 Â¢/kWh. Wind power production is moderate, and price fluctuations remain mild.

**Tuesday** sees a slight increase in prices, with an average price of 2.3 Â¢/kWh. The maximum price occurs in the morning and can rise to 6.7 cents. Variations in wind power production may cause prices to rise, especially in the morning from 7 AM to 9 AM.
