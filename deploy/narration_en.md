Power prices will be variable next week. **Sunday** will be low at a 2,8 ¢ average, and **Monday** and **Friday** will stay around four cents. Higher daily averages will appear on **Tuesday** (8,1 ¢) and **Wednesday** (7,9 ¢), with **Thursday** in between at 6,2 ¢. The cheapest day will be **Saturday**, as the average dips to 1,3 ¢ and the range stays within 0,5–2,1 ¢. Saturday’s very strong wind power will explain the low price level, whereas **Tuesday’s** generally weak wind output will support elevated prices.

The risk of price spikes will apply only to specific periods. On **Tuesday**, the expected daily peak will be 12,5 ¢, timed to the morning at 07:00–09:00. On the same day, minimum wind output will fall to 1296 MW, which explains the higher maximum price. On **Thursday**, the spike will fall in the evening at 20:00–22:00, with a peak of 9,9 ¢. The cheapest hours will cluster on **Saturday**, but on **Sunday** prices will generally remain below five cents.
