Weekly price development will lean toward moderate levels, but an exception will appear especially on **Tuesday**. The day’s average price is projected at 10,5 ¢ and the maximum at 18,1 ¢. A high risk of hourly price spikes is flagged for Tuesday, with the peak likely around 17:00–19:00. Weak wind supports the explanation: Tuesday’s minimum output will drop to 1209 MW, which coincides with the higher maximum price.

On the other days, prices will settle near the 4–6 ¢ range. On **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, average prices will hold at 5,2 and 4,3 ¢, and strong wind will appear to depress prices. On **Friday**, an affordable average is still expected, and the week’s cheapest hours will likely fall in the early hours of Friday, when prices dip near 1,5 ¢. On **Saturday** and **Sunday**, averages return to around 5–6 ¢, and evening peaks in places rise close to 10 ¢ without a separate spike risk. Morning and evening peaks on weekdays will stand out, but the clearest deviation from the overall pattern will be Tuesday evening.
