During the upcoming week, the electricity market price will vary considerably from day to day. The greatest fluctuations will occur during the weekend and early next week.

On **Thursday**, the average price will remain below one cent per kilowatt-hour, making the day inexpensive for electricity users. Prices will drop to near-zero levels in the afternoon between 15:00 and 16:00. On **Friday**, negative prices will occur overnight, reaching as low as -1,4 cents per kilowatt-hour around 04:00. Friday's average price will remain close to zero.

**Saturday** stands out as the day with notably higher prices during certain hours. The daily average will reach 3,9 cents, and peak prices are expected in the evening between 19:00 and 21:00, when the price may temporarily exceed 13 cents per kilowatt-hour. Saturday's price spikes are mainly explained by very low wind power production, dropping as low as 190 MW at its minimum.

On **Sunday**, negative hourly prices will appear again in the afternoon. However, the day's average price will remain moderate at 1,7 cents. Sunday evening prices will rise moderately, peaking around 6,4 cents in the evening hours between 19:00 and 21:00.

Early next week will start with slightly higher prices. On **Monday**, the average price will rise to 4,3 cents, and the day's peak, over 9 cents, will occur in the evening between 18:00 and 20:00. Prices on Tuesday and Wednesday will stabilize somewhat, although Wednesday will again experience brief periods of negative prices in the early morning hours.

Overall, the variation in prices over the coming days will be significant, and individual hourly price spikes will occur particularly on Saturday, Sunday, Monday, and Wednesday.
