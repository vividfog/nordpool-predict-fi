A two-part week will be expected. **On Wednesday** the average price will rise to 14,8 Â¢ and the peak to 24,5 Â¢. Spike risk will be high especially at 16:00â€“18:00 and 08:00â€“10:00. Minimum wind output will drop to 268 MW, which will explain the dayâ€™s high peak. **On Thursday** the spike risk will continue in the morning at 08:00â€“10:00, and the 16,7 Â¢ maximum will be supported by weak wind (averaging 1â€¯873 MW). **On Friday** the peak will be projected for 17:00â€“19:00 (maximum 20,6 Â¢), and a clearly subâ€‘2â€¯000 MW minimum (774 MW) will be a key factor.

**On Saturday** it will be a public holiday, so demand may be lower than usual and prices will generally stay low; a small uptick may occur at 10:00â€“12:00. **On Sunday** the forecast will dip very low and the minimum will turn negative, around -0,3 Â¢ at 02:00â€“04:00. **On Monday** and **Tuesday** wind production will be plentiful (over 3â€¯000 MW on average), which will keep prices mostly below four cents. The cheapest stretches will land from Sunday through Tuesday, while the weekâ€™s clearly most expensive day will be Wednesday, with a 24,5 Â¢ peak.
