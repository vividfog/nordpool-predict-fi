*The early week stays inexpensive, the weekend fluctuates moderately, and Tuesday becomes clearly the most expensive due to weak wind and single-hour spike risks.*

|:-------------|:----------------:|:----------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| **Wednesday** | 1,0 | -0,1 - 1,7 | 4042 - 4783 | 6,9 |
| **Thursday** | 4,7 | 0,3 - 11,0 | 2069 - 4286 | 7,1 |
| **Friday** | 6,0 | 1,3 - 15,4 | 668 - 3503 | 6,6 |
| **Saturday** | 1,8 | 0,2 - 4,1 | 3070 - 4662 | 6,4 |
| **Sunday** | 4,0 | 0,7 - 10,1 | 782 - 3739 | 5,4 |
| **Monday** | 5,9 | 2,1 - 9,8 | 1655 - 3381 | 3,1 |
| **Tuesday** | 12,4 | 3,7 - 21,9 | 761 - 2471 | 1,2 |

The start of the week will be clearly inexpensive. **Wednesday** will average 1,0 ¢, and the price will dip briefly below zero around 02–04. **Thursday** will keep the average below five cents. **Saturday** will return to a similarly inexpensive level. **Friday** and **Monday** will edge closer to six cents on average. The clear outlier will be **Tuesday**, when the average will rise to 12,4 ¢ and the day’s maximum is forecast at 21,9 ¢. Tuesday’s high peak is partly explained by a very low minimum wind output (761 MW).

Spike risks for single hours will stand out only in certain cases. **Friday** morning is expected to see elevated prices around 08–10. **Sunday** is a public holiday, which may ease demand, but a spike risk is still expected in the morning around 08–10. On **Tuesday**, spike risks are anticipated both in the morning at 08–10 and in the early evening at 17–19, in line with weak wind during the day. On other days, price variation will remain more moderate without notable swings.
