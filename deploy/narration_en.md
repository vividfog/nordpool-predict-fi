The abundant supply of wind power on Friday explains the low prices.

**Saturday** will be the most affordable day of the week, with an average price of just 0.6 ¢/kWh. **Sunday** also offers low prices, with the daily average rising slightly to 0.8 ¢/kWh. On both days, there will be plenty of wind power, which contributes to lowering prices.

**On Monday**, prices will rise slightly, with the average being 2.9 ¢/kWh but still at a low level. **On Tuesday**, prices will rise again, with a daily average of 5.6 ¢/kWh. **Wednesday** will have the highest prices of the week, with an average price of 10.8 ¢/kWh. The amount of wind power on Wednesday will be the lowest, which explains the higher price level. Price spikes are possible especially on Wednesday, as the minimum wind power production combined with a high maximum price indicates a risk of price spikes.
