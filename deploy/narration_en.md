The upcoming week's electricity market is expected to show variable price developments. **Thursday** may see significant price fluctuations throughout the day, with prices potentially rising over 20 cents, making it the most expensive day of the week. This higher price level might be due to wind power minimum production being below 1000 MW. **Wednesday** also anticipates price spikes, with the day's average price reaching a high of 8.3 cents.

Over the weekend, prices drop considerably. On **Friday** and **Saturday**, average prices remain low, at around 3.3 and 2.5 cents, respectively. During these days, wind power is abundantly available, which partly explains the low prices. On **Sunday**, the average electricity price remains moderate at 4.2 cents, although wind power production is significantly lower compared to Friday and Saturday.

At the beginning of the week, **Monday** and **Tuesday** see electricity prices stabilize at normal levels. On Monday, the average price is slightly higher, at 5.7 cents, but on Tuesday, prices fall back to 3.5 cents. As the week progresses, wind power levels vary, but no major deviations are expected.
