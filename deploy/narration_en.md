Electricity price expectations vary significantly in the coming week. **Monday** is expected to have the highest average price of the week, at 7.9 ¬¢/kWh, with the daily maximum price potentially reaching up to 18.2 cents. Wind power production is forecasted to be weak, which may partly explain the higher price levels. The risks of high maximum prices are particularly associated with the morning and evening hours, such as between 9-11 and 19-21.

**Tuesday** sees a slightly more moderate average price of 6.1 ¬¢/kWh, but price spikes are still anticipated, especially in the morning between 8-10. Wednesday offers some relief from price pressures, with an average price of 3.0 ¬¢/kWh. However, the maximum price is expected to rise to as high as 6.2 cents.

The most affordable days of the week are **Thursday**, **Friday**, and **Saturday**, with average prices below 1.0 ¬¢/kWh. Negative minimum prices are even forecasted for Thursday and Friday. Wind power production will be high on these days, partially explaining the low prices.

Overall, the week presents varying price expectations, with **Monday** standing out for its high average and maximum prices. The weekend's more affordable prices provide consumers relief from long-term price pressures.
