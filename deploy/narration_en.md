|:-------------|:----------------:|:----------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| **Tuesday** | 0,7 | -0,4 - 2,4 | 3047 - 6404 | 5,0 |
| **Wednesday** | 0,6 | -0,6 - 1,7 | 4007 - 5458 | 6,9 |
| **Thursday** | 5,8 | 0,1 - 16,2 | 1311 - 4231 | 7,1 |
| **Friday** | 4,9 | 1,4 - 11,9 | 1041 - 3394 | 6,6 |
| **Saturday** | 2,8 | 1,3 - 4,4 | 2391 - 3158 | 6,4 |
| **Sunday** | 3,5 | 1,4 - 7,8 | 1123 - 3635 | 5,4 |
| **Monday** | 11,0 | 4,0 - 19,9 | 626 - 1611 | 3,1 |

Prices will be very low early in the week. **Tuesday** and **Wednesday** will include negative night-time hours. **Thursday** will shift clearly higher as the average reaches 5,8 ¢. **Friday’s** average will be 4,9 ¢ and **Saturday’s** 2,8 ¢. **Sunday’s** average will be 3,5 ¢; it is a holiday, which typically lowers demand. Next **Monday** will already be expensive on average, 11,0 ¢, which will widen the week’s spread.

Spike risk will concentrate on Thursday, Friday, Sunday and Monday. Thursday’s peaks will land around 16–18, on Friday around 8–10 and on Sunday around 9–11. Next Monday the peak hours will most likely occur around 17–19, when the highest level in the forecast, 19,9 ¢, will be reached. Monday’s very low wind minimum (626 MW) will help explain the high maximum price, and individual peaks could materialize above the forecast. Thursday’s spikes will also be linked to the day’s low wind trough (about 1 311 MW).
