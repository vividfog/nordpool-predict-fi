Price levels will vary clearly over the week. **Friday** will stand out as the most expensive day with an average price of 14,4 ¢ and the highest peak at 26,1 ¢. **Sunday** will be the opposite: the average dips to 4,7 ¢ and individual hours will fall below three cents. The start and end of the week will remain above mid-level: **Thursday’s** average is 11,1 ¢, **Tuesday’s** 13,1 ¢ and **Wednesday’s** 13,3 ¢, whereas **on Saturday** and **on Monday** levels will be clearly lower.

Spike risk is anticipated on several days. **On Thursday**, the peak would fall in the morning at 08–10 (up to 15,2 ¢). **On Friday**, the highest hour would be in the evening at 17–19 (26,1 ¢); an exceptionally low wind power minimum, 599 MW, explains this. **On Saturday**, a possible spike would be in the morning at 08–10, but the level would remain around 10 cents. **On Tuesday**, the peak would occur at 16–18 (19,8 ¢) and **on Wednesday** at 08–10 (18,1 ¢); on both days, low minimum wind production correlates with these increases. **On Sunday**, the overall level would remain low, reflecting strong wind output.
