Next week's electricity price forecast shows significant variations between days. **Monday** stands out with a predicted average price of 7.3 ¬¢/kWh and the highest maximum price of 19.7 ¬¢/kWh, likely due to low wind power in the morning and evening hours. Price spikes are expected on **Monday** and **Tuesday**, particularly in the evening when electricity consumption is highest. Starting from Wednesday, prices are set to decrease significantly, with **Saturday** being the most economical day at only 1.3 cents on average.

Prices for **Wednesday** and **Thursday** are predicted to be quite low, partly due to strong wind power exceeding 3000 MW on average. This corresponds to **Wednesday's** predicted average wind power production of 3185 MW, which partially explains the low price level. **Friday's** and **Saturday's** prices remain low, even though wind power production is slightly reduced.

On **Sunday**, prices rise again, with an average forecast of 4.1 ¬¢/kWh, the highest over the weekend. There is a risk of price spikes, especially in the evening, when wind power production decreases and electricity demand increases. This could lead to price increases during individual hours.
