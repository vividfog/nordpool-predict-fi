During the upcoming week, electricity prices will remain generally affordable, but noticeable differences between days will emerge. **Monday** stands out early in the week, with average prices rising above five cents per kilowatt-hour. Monday's peak prices will occur around nine in the morning, with electricity rates expected to reach as high as 8.3 cents.

The weekend will start very affordably. **Saturday's** average price will stay below one and a half cents, with the cheapest hours occurring at night between midnight and two AM. On **Sunday**, negative hourly prices will appear during the early hours around midnight to two AM, meaning electricity will be essentially free, even slightly below zero. However, Sunday's average price will remain slightly higher than Saturday, around two cents.

As the week progresses, prices will rise moderately. On **Tuesday**, the average price will climb to about four and a half cents, with the highest hourly price around eight in the morning reaching 7.6 cents. On **Wednesday**, the week's highest individual hourly price will occur around eight in the evening, with electricity rates forecasted to reach up to 9.4 cents. Wednesday's average price will be the week's highest, around 5.8 cents. Prices will then slightly decrease towards the end of the week.

At the end of the week, on **Thursday** and **Friday**, average prices will remain below five cents. Thursday's highest hourly price will take place around nine in the morning, reaching approximately 7.9 cents. On Friday, peak hours will occur around ten in the morning, with prices rising to 7.1 cents.

Overall, clear differences between days will emerge during the week, and variations in hourly prices will be significant, especially during midweek morning and evening hours. The risk of price spikes during individual hours has been noted for each day, meaning actual peak prices could differ slightly from this forecast.
