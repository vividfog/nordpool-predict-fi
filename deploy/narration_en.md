The start of the week will look expensive: **Tuesday** and **Wednesday** will hold at an average of 13,7 ¢, and the week’s highest single price will be on Tuesday at 20,9 ¢. Wind will be very weak (below 1000 MW on average), which would explain the elevated levels. After **Thursday** (11,6 ¢) and **Friday** (13,5 ¢), the price level will ease towards the weekend. Abundant wind power will depress prices: **Sunday’s** average will remain at 4,4 ¢, and **Monday’s** at 7,6 ¢.

Spike risk is highlighted in particular: **Wednesday** spikes could land in the morning at 08:00–10:00 and in the evening at 17:00–19:00. **Thursday** will see pressure in the morning at 08:00–10:00. **Friday’s** highest hour would fall in the afternoon at 15:00–17:00. **Saturday** may see isolated spikes in the evening at 18:00–20:00, even though levels will stay clearly below 15 ¢. For Sunday and Monday no spike risk is mentioned, and daily prices will remain low.
