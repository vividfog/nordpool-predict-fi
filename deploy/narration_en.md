In the week’s power price outlook, **Friday’s** average will rise to 10,5 cents, and the day’s high is projected at 19,6 ¢ in the evening around 17:00–19:00. **Sunday** will stand out as the cheapest by far: the average will be 2,0 ¢ and hourly prices will mostly stay between 1–3 ¢. The start of the week will even out: **Monday’s** average will be 4,6 ¢ and **Tuesday’s** 7,1 ¢, while **Wednesday’s** average will edge up to 9,2 ¢. **Thursday’s** average will settle at 6,5 ¢.

Spike risk is noted separately: on **Saturday**, isolated spikes may occur in the morning at 07:00–09:00, when the day’s peak is forecast at 12,4 ¢. On **Wednesday**, spike risk will be emphasized in the evening at 17:00–19:00 (the day’s high 14,1 ¢). On **Thursday**, the risk will lean toward the evening at 18:00–20:00, even though the forecast maximum is a moderate 9,2 ¢. Wind power variability supports this: Saturday’s minimum output will remain very low (573 MW), and Wednesday’s trough will also be low (1752 MW). The week’s cheapest periods will fall especially during Sunday’s night and daytime hours, while prices on Friday evening will be clearly higher.
