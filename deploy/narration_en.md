The upcoming week's electricity prices in Finland are expected to vary fairly steadily, without major deviations. On **Wednesday**, the highest maximum price of the week, 8.3 cents, is anticipated, while on **Sunday**, the minimum price could be as low as 0.2 cents. This suggests that electricity prices may fluctuate significantly throughout the day, especially on Wednesday. The average wind power production for the week remains weak, but on Wednesday, wind power production could vary significantly, partly explaining the higher prices.

**Thursday's** average price of 3.9 cents and potential price spikes during certain hours may be significant for consumers. On **Friday**, the average price drops slightly, but price spikes may also occur then. **Saturday** is forecasted to have an average price of 3.3 cents, but the maximum price can rise to seven cents. This may be due, among other factors, to variable wind power production.

**Sunday** is expected to be the most affordable day of the week, with an average price of only 2.4 cents. This could be an attractive day for electricity usage. **Monday** sees prices rising again, with higher prices expected especially in the evening. At the end of the week, **Tuesday's** forecast shows an average price of 3.9 cents, and wind power production remains low, which may influence the rise in prices.
