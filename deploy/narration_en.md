Electricity prices for the upcoming week will vary considerably from day to day. Particular attention should be paid to **Saturday**, when the average electricity price will rise to 5.5 cents. Saturday will also bring the week's highest price peaks, with prices anticipated to rise above 18 Â¢ during the morning hours between 9â€“11. Saturday's elevated price level results from minimal wind power generation, dropping to just above 200 megawatts at its lowest point.

Conversely, **Sunday** will see electricity prices become negative, averaging -0.5 Â¢ for the day. Electricity users could thus benefit from extremely low prices throughout most of the day. Sunday's negative prices will be due to abundant wind power availability, with generation peaking at nearly 4,000 megawatts.

On weekdays, electricity prices will remain moderate. On **Monday** and **Tuesday**, the average price will be 1.3 cents, and both days will also experience brief negative prices during nighttime and early morning hours. Prices will further decline slightly on **Wednesday**, with an average daily price below one cent. The cheapest moment of the weekdays will occur overnight into Wednesday, with prices dipping as low as -0.6 cents.

On Thursday, the average price will rise to 2.5 cents, and isolated price spikes may briefly exceed 5 cents per hour during the day. On Friday, prices will continue to remain moderate, averaging 1.8 cents, although brief price increases approaching 4 cents could occur in the morning hours.

Overall, the week's price expectations will fluctuate considerably. Saturday morning's high peak prices will make it the week's most expensive day, while Sunday's negative prices will offer the most affordable electricity. Weekday prices will remain moderate, and no significant price surprises are expected, although brief short-term increases may still occur.
