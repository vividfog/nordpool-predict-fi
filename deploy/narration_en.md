The cheapest day of the week is expected to be **Saturday**, when the average price will stay at 4,5 cents and the day’s high will be 6,3 ¢. On **Sunday**, the price level will already rise clearly, as the average will be 7,4 ¢ and prices will reach 11,0 cents.

The price peak is expected to occur next **Tuesday**, when the average will climb to 16,3 cents and the day’s maximum is forecast at 23,4 ¢. The risk of high hourly pricing will be emphasized early in the week and will continue next **Wednesday**, **Thursday**, and **Friday**. On an hourly level, the steepest figures will be concentrated in the late morning, and for example Tuesday’s highest price is expected around 09:00–11:00. The overall picture will be clearly more expensive on weekdays than over the weekend, and on several days the range will stretch to more than ten cents.
