The start of the week is expected to be calm. **On Wednesday**, the average price is expected to be very low, 2,4 ¢, with a range of 0,0–6,3 ¢. Strong wind generation would explain the low level. **On Thursday**, the level would move to a mid-range (avg 5,8 ¢), and prices would stay between 2,9–8,3 ¢.

Later in the week, the price level would tighten. **Friday** will likely see the week’s highest average, 11,0 ¢, with a projected maximum of 20,2 ¢. The high hourly peak would most likely occur around 17–19, and the driver is an exceptionally low wind minimum (588 MW). **On Saturday**, which is a public holiday, a spike risk would still appear in the late morning around 9–11. **On Sunday**, the risk would shift to the evening, roughly 17–19. **On Monday** (avg 9,2 ¢), a potential peak would fall around 17–19, with wind still weak. **On Tuesday** (avg 10,5 ¢), the maximum is forecast at 18,6 ¢; the peak would tilt towards the morning hours around 9–11, and the low wind minimum (1038 MW) would support higher hourly prices.
