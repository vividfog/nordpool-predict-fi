*Next week, electricity prices will vary significantly, from Wednesday's peak prices to the low prices over the weekend. Notably, Friday and Tuesday are expected to see price spikes, while the weekend offers more affordable forecasts due to increased wind power.*

Nuclear power plant maintenance outages are currently affecting electricity price forecasts in Finland. Loviisa 1 is out of operation for maintenance from September 6, 2025, at 10:00 to September 24, 2025, at 00:00. Similarly, Loviisa 2 is undergoing maintenance from August 17, 2025, at 04:00 to September 17, 2025, at 02:00. These maintenance outages may impact the accuracy of the forecasts, as there is limited training data available from periods with outages.

The coming week presents significant variations in electricity prices. **Wednesday** is expected to have the highest prices of the week, peaking at 23.1 cents, partly due to low wind power production of only 842 MW. **Saturday** and **Sunday**, on the other hand, will be much more affordable, with prices staying below 5 cents. These days also stand out with strong wind power, which partly explains the low prices.

**Thursday** and **Friday** will see more stable price trends, but Friday is expected to have individual price spikes, with prices potentially rising temporarily. **Tuesday** is also forecasted to experience price spikes, with the maximum price reaching up to 20.5 cents, particularly during the evening hours.

**Monday** will see moderate prices, though not as low as during the weekend. The weekend weather will be cool, but it is not expected to have a significant impact on electricity prices.
