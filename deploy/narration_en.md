Based on the forecast for the coming week, electricity prices will vary significantly. **Thursday** and **Friday** are expected to have higher prices, with the average price close to eight cents per kilowatt-hour. There is also a significant risk of price spikes on these days, especially during the morning and evening hours when electricity consumption is typically at its highest.

**Saturday** brings a notably cheaper price level, with an average price of only 4.1 ¢/kWh. **Sunday** also stands out with an extremely low average price of just 0.9 ¢/kWh, due to strong wind power production. At this time, wind power is forecasted to be available at over 3000 MW, which pushes the price down.

**Monday** continues the trend of low price development, with an average price of 2.1 ¢/kWh. Wind power production remains high, helping to keep prices low. **Tuesday** and **Wednesday** see prices rise slightly again but remain reasonable, with average prices at 4.5 ¢ and 6.0 ¢/kWh respectively. However, there is a risk of individual price spikes on both days.
