Early-week prices are expected to be low. **Sunday** is set to average 2.4 ¢ with most hours staying below 5.4 ¢; just after midnight, levels as low as 0.2 ¢ are anticipated. **Tuesday** and **Wednesday** are expected to average around 3.7–3.8 ¢. Abundant wind power will explain the low level on several days.

**Thursday** is forecast to rise to an 8.9 ¢ average with individual spikes around 08:00–10:00 (peak 12.9 ¢). Weaker wind (min 1,438 MW) explains the increase. **Friday** is expected to be the week’s highest at 10.8 ¢, with the peak in the late afternoon 16:00–18:00 (19.4 ¢); the backdrop is exceptionally low minimum wind output at 870 MW. **Saturday** is a holiday, expected to pull the average down to 5.8 ¢, but spike risk remains in the late morning 09:00–11:00 (12.3 ¢) as the wind minimum dips to 801 MW.
