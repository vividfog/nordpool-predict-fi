Weekend prices will remain very low. On **Saturday** the average price will be 0.4 ¢ and many hours will hover around zero. **Sunday** will continue below five cents (avg 2.7 ¢). At the start of the week prices will rise: on **Monday** the average will be 9.8 ¢ and on **Tuesday** 9.2 ¢. Monday stands out with the week’s highest hourly price, 16.5 ¢, roughly around 17:00–19:00. A clear spike risk is indicated for the day, and the minimum wind output will drop below 1,000 MW (998 MW), which partly explains the peak. Tuesday also carries a spike risk; the day’s top hour will reach 13.5 ¢, likely during the evening peak.

Midweek, **Wednesday** and **Thursday** will be public holidays, which may curb demand and keep prices in check. The averages will settle at 7.5 and 6.6 cents, and the swings will remain milder than on Monday. At the end of the week **Friday** will be low again (avg 1.7 ¢), with a range of 1.0–2.6 ¢. The week’s cheapest hours will fall overnight and early morning on Saturday, while the priciest period will land on Monday evening.
