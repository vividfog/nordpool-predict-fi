Weekly price levels will vary. The cheapest days are expected at the weekend, with **Sunday** and **Saturday** averaging around five to six cents. The clearly most expensive day will be **Friday**, with an average of 13,4 ¢ and a maximum of 20,3 ¢ at 17:00–19:00. This is linked to the low minimum wind output (1237 MW), which supports a higher peak. A risk of price spikes is stated for each day, and spikes will concentrate in morning and evening hours.

Early in the week, on **Monday**, the highest levels will occur at 08:00–10:00 (about 16,5 ¢). On **Tuesday**, an evening peak is seen at 17:00–19:00 (17,8 ¢), and on **Wednesday** the top hour will be in the morning at 08:00–10:00 (18,7 ¢). On **Thursday**, the 08:00–10:00 slot will reach up to 14,9 ¢. Within the weekend, on **Sunday** the 17:00–19:00 price will touch 13,8 ¢, whereas on **Saturday** the maxima will stay below 8,5 ¢. Intra-day variation will at times be large, so following individual hours will be worthwhile especially around morning and evening demand peaks.
