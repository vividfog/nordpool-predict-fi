The upcoming week will bring variable electricity prices. Prices will rise slightly at the beginning of the week, but clearly decrease toward the weekend.

During the same day, hourly price fluctuations will be significant, and the highest prices will occur in the morning hours between 8â€“10 am, approaching nine cents. On Tuesday, wind power production will also drop momentarily to very low levels, partly explaining the formation of the price peak.

On **Thursday**, price fluctuations will continue, but slightly more moderately compared to previous days. The average price will settle around 4.3 cents, and the highest price of the day, 7.2 cents, will occur around 9 am. Toward the weekend, price levels will decrease further, and average prices on **Friday** will remain at three cents. While Friday will have individual hours with prices rising close to five cents, these instances will be brief and occur in the evening.

Weekend prices will be very affordable. On **Saturday**, the average electricity price will remain under two cents, and negative prices will even occur overnight. Between 2â€“4 am, the lowest hourly price will be -0.2 cents per kilowatt-hour. On **Sunday**, prices will remain very low, with the average price staying below two cents.
