The start of the week will be inexpensive. **Tuesday** and **Wednesday** will settle at low levels, with Wednesday’s average at 3,3 ¢. **Friday** will stand out as the most expensive: the average will be 10,3 ¢ and the day’s high will reach 17,2 ¢. The public holiday **Saturday** will dampen demand, so the average will sit at 6,1 ¢, and Sunday will stay close to the same level. Next **Monday** the average will rise to 9,1 ¢. The lowest hours will be on Tuesday evening around 21:00–23:00, when the price will drop below one cent.

**Friday’s** price spike risk will be clearly elevated, with the peak most likely at 17:00–19:00. The day’s high will be explained by low minimum wind output (842 MW), which is well below 2,000 MW. The holiday **Saturday** may also bring individual spikes in the morning at 08:00–10:00. On **Sunday**, the focus will be late afternoon–evening at 16:00–18:00. Next **Monday** the risks will tilt toward the morning at 08:00–10:00. As the week progresses, weak wind on several days will support a higher price level, while strong winds early in the week will push prices lower.
