According to the upcoming week's electricity price forecast, **Wednesday** and **Friday** are expected to see slightly higher average prices, while prices will clearly drop to much lower levels over the weekend. **On Friday**, the maximum price will rise significantly to 12.4 ¢/kWh, especially between morning and afternoon, explained by low minimum wind power production. **Wednesday** holds a risk of price spikes, particularly during evening hours around 6-8 PM.

**Sunday** stands out as the cheapest day of the week, with an average price forecasted at 1.2 ¢/kWh and the maximum price staying below 3 ¢/kWh. This low price is explained by abundant wind power production. **Monday** sees prices rise slightly from Sunday, but they remain moderate, with an average price of 2.9 ¢/kWh.

Throughout the week, wind power production varies, but on average it remains at a normal level, not expected to significantly impact prices. Only **on Friday** might low minimum production cause temporary price increases.
