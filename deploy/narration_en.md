Electricity prices will see considerable day-to-day fluctuations this week. Particularly **Wednesday** stands out as the most expensive day, with an average price climbing to 8.7 cents per kilowatt-hour and peak prices reaching over 17¬¢. The highest price spike on Wednesday is expected during morning hours between 8‚Äì10 AM, when prices might surpass forecasts.

On **Tuesday** prices will also occasionally be significantly high. While the day's average price remains slightly under five cents, evening hours between 7‚Äì9 PM could see prices exceed 15 cents. Both Tuesday's and Wednesday's high price peaks can partly be explained by weak wind power production; wind energy is particularly low on Wednesday, dropping to a minimum of just 195 MW.

The week's most affordable day will be **Friday**, when the average electricity price is expected to remain below two cents, and prices will stay low throughout the entire day. Early Friday morning will even see negative electricity prices, bottoming out at -0.5 cents. This is due to strong wind power production, which on Friday is forecasted to surpass 3500 MW.

Over the weekend, prices will remain moderate. On **Saturday** and **Sunday** average prices will hover around 3‚Äì4 cents. On Saturday morning between 9‚Äì10 AM prices are forecasted to reach their highest level, around seven cents, though overall prices will remain reasonable.

Early next week, on **Monday**, prices are expected to rise again slightly. The average price will approach five cents per kilowatt-hour, with potential price peaks exceeding 12 cents occurring during the evening hours between 7‚Äì9 PM.
