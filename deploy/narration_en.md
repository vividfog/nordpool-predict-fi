The week's price development is variable, with **Saturday** standing out due to the risk of price spikes. During this day, the electricity price can rise to as much as 14.7 ¢/kWh, which is significantly higher than the maximum prices on other days. **Sunday** continues with a relatively high average price of 5.0 ¢/kWh, which may partly be explained by low wind power production, remaining below 2000 MW.

**Monday** is expected to see a decrease in the average price, reaching 2.9 ¢/kWh. During this time, strong wind power, over 3000 MW, may explain the low price level. **Tuesday** sees a slight increase in price, with the average being 3.3 ¢/kWh. Wind power production remains strong, which may keep prices moderate.

**Wednesday** is balanced in the week's price development, with an average price of 4.3 ¢/kWh, but price fluctuations may occur throughout the day. **Thursday** and **Friday** continue on a more affordable path, with wind power remaining high and price development staying moderate.
