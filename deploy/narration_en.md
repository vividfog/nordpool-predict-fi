The weekly price picture will be moderate, but clear differences between days will be seen. On **Friday** the week’s highest average price, 8,8 ¢, and also the week’s sharpest peak, 14,8 ¢, will be recorded. Wind power minimum production will dip to 1545 MW, which supports the evening peak. The risk of single-hour spikes will be highlighted especially at 17:00–19:00. On **Saturday** the average price will be lower than Friday, but minimum production will drop exceptionally low, at 856 MW. Morning prices may rise clearly, and spike risk will be present especially at 07:00–09:00.

The week’s lowest averages will occur on **Sunday** (3,3 ¢) and **Monday** (3,6 ¢), and abundant wind output (>3000 MW) will support the low price level. On **Tuesday** and **Wednesday** levels will stay mid-range, although individual hours above 10 ¢ may occur during the daytime. **Thursday** will be closer to the week’s middle line, and on most days several hours below four cents will occur at night.
