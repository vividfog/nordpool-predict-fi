**On Saturday**, electricity prices are expected to be quite reasonable, averaging 1.7 ¬¢/kWh, although price spikes are anticipated. Wind power availability is expected to fluctuate significantly, which may explain the price variations. **On Sunday**, the average price rises slightly to 2.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. Wind power production is expected to be at its lowest for the week, which might contribute to the price increase.

**Monday** stands out as the most expensive day of the week with an average price of 3.6 ¬¢/kWh. The low wind power production, combined with the potential for price spikes, may explain Monday's higher price. On Tuesday, prices drop significantly, with the expected average price at just 1.4 cents. Wind power production is expected to be at a moderate level, helping to keep prices moderate.

**On Wednesday**, electricity prices remain low, averaging 0.9 ¬¢/kWh, and the minimum price may even drop to negative. This is due to strong wind power production, which is the highest for the week. **On Thursday**, prices rise slightly again but remain moderate with an average price of 2.1 ¬¢/kWh. **Friday's** average price is 3.0 cents, with potential price spikes. The electricity market is expected to experience quite large fluctuations during the week, but Monday's and Friday's higher prices are particularly noteworthy.
