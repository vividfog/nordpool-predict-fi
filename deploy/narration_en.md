*Next week, electricity price forecasts vary significantly, with prices expected to rise notably towards the end of the week. Wind power production and price spikes influence price expectations, so consumers should monitor the situation closely.*

There is an ongoing maintenance outage at the Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant, which began on September 20 at 01:00 and is expected to end on October 10 at 01:00. The Loviisa 1 plant is also under maintenance from September 6 at 10:00, with completion expected on September 29 at 12:00. These maintenance outages may affect the accuracy of forecasts, as training data from outage periods is limited.

The forecast was updated on Saturday at 12:07.

In the coming week, electricity price trends appear variable. **Monday** and **Tuesday** are expected to be the most affordable days, with average prices below two cents, due to high wind power production. **Wednesday** brings a significant price increase, with the average price rising above five cents. This may be due to a decrease in wind power production and higher demand.

On **Thursday**, prices remain high, with potential price spikes expected during the late morning and afternoon hours. **Friday** is the most expensive day of the week, with average prices exceeding ten cents. This is partly due to low wind power production, which falls below 1000 MW at certain times, affecting price increases.

Over the weekend, **Saturday** still sees high prices but does not reach Friday's levels. Individual price spikes may still occur in the morning and evening hours.
