The price trend will appear twofold: prices will stay low late in the week, whereas mid-week and the start of the week will lift averages. The week’s highest prices will fall on **Wednesday**, with an average of 12,0 ¢ and a risk of spikes for individual hours. The morning peak would occur around 08:00–10:00 and could reach about 18,2 ¢. On **Thursday** the level would settle clearly. On **Friday** and **Saturday** the averages will remain clearly below four cents. On **Monday** the average will rise to 7,3 ¢ and on **Tuesday** to 6,6 ¢.

The cheapest electricity is expected over the weekend: during **Friday** and **Saturday** hours prices will mostly stay below four cents. The lowest readings are forecast from Saturday evening into the night (22:00–24:00 about 1,6–1,9 ¢) and into early **Sunday morning** (00:00–02:00 about 1,4–1,6 ¢). Abundant wind power on most days will support the low price level, and on **Monday** output will be the week’s lowest, which will show up as a slightly higher average.
