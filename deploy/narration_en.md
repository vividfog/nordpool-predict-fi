*The week splits in two: from Sunday to Wednesday very cheap, on Thursday and partly Saturday risk of hourly spikes, Friday’s average elevated — overall lowest prices early in the week.*

The forecast was updated on Thursday at 21:01.

| **Friday** | 7,4 | 0,6 - 16,7 | 374 - 2539 | 4,5 |
| **Saturday** | 7,5 | 0,7 - 14,7 | 140 - 1990 | 4,5 |
| **Sunday** | 1,6 | -0,2 - 4,2 | 2209 - 4256 | 4,7 |
| **Monday** | 4,0 | 1,2 - 7,4 | 2133 - 3867 | 4,1 |
| **Tuesday** | 1,9 | 0,3 - 3,1 | 3195 - 3960 | 5,0 |
| **Wednesday** | 1,7 | -0,3 - 4,0 | 3316 - 4909 | 6,9 |
| **Thursday** | 7,6 | 0,3 - 22,2 | 442 - 5193 | 7,1 |

The week’s price trend is expected to split in two. After Friday and the early hours of the weekend, the level would drop clearly: **Sunday** would average 1,6 ¢, and individual overnight hours would turn negative around 02:00–04:00. The cheap spell would continue **Monday** and **Tuesday** with averages under four cents, and on **Wednesday** minima would briefly dip below zero around 02:00–04:00.

The clearest exception is expected **Thursday**, with an average of 7,6 ¢ and a daily high rising to 22,2 ¢. The intraday swing would be explained by a very low wind power minimum (442 MW), which would lift the peak. A high risk of hourly price spikes is also indicated for Thursday, with the highest hours most likely around 17:00–19:00. **Saturday** is also a public holiday, and although demand would be lower than usual, very low wind output could lift individual hours; the spike risk would focus especially around 10:00–12:00. Overall, the cheapest stretch would be Sunday–Wednesday, whereas the week’s sharpest peaks would cluster on Thursday evening.
