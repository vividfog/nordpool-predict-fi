In the upcoming week's forecasts, electricity prices vary significantly. **Tuesday** offers the lowest average prices of the week, ranging from -0.7 to 4.2 ¬¢/kWh, likely due to higher wind power production on that day. On **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, however, there is a clear risk of price spikes, with maximum prices exceeding 10 ¬¢/kWh. Wind power production on these days is also lower, which may contribute to rising prices. **Monday's** predicted prices are relatively low, but variability is expected within the day, particularly during morning and evening hours. During the weekend, especially on **Saturday**, prices will temporarily rise to a peak of 12.2 ¬¢/kWh, potentially causing price surges.

Wind power production varies significantly throughout the week and clearly influences price fluctuations. **Wednesday** sees the lowest wind power production, which partly drives up prices. Higher prices on Wednesday and Saturday are partly due to the lack of wind power and possibly other market factors. The average temperatures for the week remain moderate and are not expected to significantly impact prices. *Forecast insights by gpt-4o.* üå¨Ô∏è
