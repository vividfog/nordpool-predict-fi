The week’s price level will vary clearly by day. The lowest averages will be seen on **Wednesday** at 2,8 ¢ and on **Sunday** at 3,0 ¢. The most expensive day will be **Friday**, with the average rising to 8,4 ¢ and the week’s highest hourly price at 14,6 ¢ within the day. Cheap hours will occur especially during **Sunday’s** night, when between 01:00–03:00 the price drops to zero. On **Saturday**, a public holiday will be observed, which may depress prices and keep the day’s average at 4,6 ¢.

The risk of price spikes will focus on **Thursday** and **Friday**. On Thursday the morning will stand out, with prices around 09:00–11:00 near the day’s high of 9,5 ¢ and remaining elevated in the afternoon 16:00–18:00. On Friday the risk will skew to the evening. The evening peak will occur at 16:00–18:00, rising to 14,6 ¢. Friday’s high peak is explained by an exceptionally weak minimum wind output, which falls below 2000 MW. Conversely, **Wednesday’s** lower prices will be supported by abundant wind generation, clearly above 3000 MW.
