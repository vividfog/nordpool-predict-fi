In the coming week, electricity exchange prices are expected to fluctuate moderately without significant changes between days. **Wednesday** is anticipated to have the lowest average price of the week at -0.5 cents, due to strong wind power production. This day's wind power production is expected to average over 3000 MW, which lowers prices. Conversely, **Sunday** is forecasted to see a slightly higher average price of 2.5 ¬¢, which might be due to weaker wind power production dropping below 1000 MW during the day. Sunday also stands out with the week's highest maximum price of 6.8 ¬¢, which could lead to price spikes especially in the evening between 20:00 and 22:00.

**Thursday** and **Saturday** have warnings of possible price spikes during individual hours. Thursday's highest price may occur during morning or evening hours when wind power production is at its lowest below 1000 MW. **Saturday's** maximum price could rise in the afternoon or evening when wind power production is weaker.

The average temperatures for the week are expected to remain generally warm, and are unlikely to significantly impact electricity prices. Wind power production is mostly at a normal level, but a few days, such as **Wednesday**, stand out with high production, keeping prices low.
