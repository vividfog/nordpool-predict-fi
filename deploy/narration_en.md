*Forecasts for electricity prices fluctuate in the coming days, as wind power production and market prices vary significantly. Consumers should prepare for price spikes, especially at the beginning of the week, when wind power production is at its lowest.*

Loviisa 1 nuclear power plant is out of operation due to maintenance. The maintenance began on September 6, 2025, at 10:00 and is expected to end on October 2, 2025, at 12:00. This maintenance may affect the accuracy of the electricity price forecast, as training data from maintenance periods is limited.

The forecast was updated on Wednesday at 12:09.

Electricity markets in the coming days appear variable. **Saturday** stands out with its low average price, forecasted to be only 0.5 ¬¢/kWh. This is partly due to strong wind power, expected to average 3641 MW. Saturday's night prices are even negative, which is rare.

On **Sunday**, there is a risk of price spikes, as price expectations vary from -0.5 cents to nearly 10 cents. The day features a wide price range, so consumers should be prepared for possible spikes, especially in the afternoon.

**Monday** and **Tuesday** bring a higher price level. Next Tuesday is particularly noteworthy as wind power production is at a minimum of just 679 MW, which, together with the high maximum price, may cause significant price spikes in the afternoon and evening.

At the start of the week, **Wednesday** brings price levels closer to the weekly forecast average. However, the risk of price spikes remains, and consumers should be cautious, particularly in the evening.
