| **Monday** | 6,9 | 3,2 - 10,3 | 2127 - 4335 | 0,7 |
| **Tuesday** | 12,6 | 4,2 - 21,5 | 403 - 2033 | 1,1 |
| **Wednesday** | 5,9 | 3,2 - 11,0 | 573 - 5143 | 1,5 |
| **Thursday** | 3,9 | 1,6 - 7,2 | 2853 - 4561 | 1,6 |
| **Friday** | 4,4 | 1,0 - 8,1 | 3438 - 5115 | -0,0 |
| **Saturday** | 5,4 | 2,5 - 8,3 | 2611 - 4108 | -2,6 |
| **Sunday** | 6,0 | 3,2 - 10,8 | 1681 - 3716 | -0,8 |

The price picture for the week will split clearly. **On Tuesday**, the average price is expected to reach 12,6 ¢ and the day’s upper bound 21,5 ¢. Behind this is very weak wind: generation is expected to average 968 MW and dip to a minimum of 403 MW. The low minimum wind output explains why Tuesday’s peak price rises clearly above the other days. The spike risk for individual hours would cluster in the evening 17:00–19:00 and around midday 10:00–12:00. **On Monday** and during the weekend days, prices will stay within the table’s ranges without exceptional extremes.

Later in the week, the price level would even out. **On Wednesday**, the average is forecast at 5,9 ¢ and the maximum at 11,0 ¢; the spike risk would lean toward the morning 07:00–09:00. **On Thursday** and **Friday**, averages will dip to the 3,9–4,4 ¢ range, influenced by ample wind power. The week’s cheapest hours would fall in the small hours of Friday 01:00–03:00, when the price will touch as low as 1,0 ¢. **On Saturday** and **Sunday**, averages will settle around 5–6 ¢, and intraday variation will remain moderate.
