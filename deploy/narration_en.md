**Friday** and **Saturday** forecasts show relatively low prices, with the average electricity price expected to be below three cents per kilowatt-hour. **Sunday** maintains a similar price level, but there is a risk of price spikes on both Saturday and Sunday during specific hours. These spikes may occur especially in the morning and evening hours when electricity demand typically increases.

**Monday** sees a slight rise in average prices, with potential spikes particularly in the morning when the price could exceed seven cents. **Tuesday** continues this upward trend, with prices expected to reach up to 7.4 cents during the day.

In the middle of the week, **Wednesday** and **Thursday** are forecasted to have higher average prices exceeding five cents. Wednesday could see prices rise as high as 8.2 cents, making it the most expensive day of the week. During these days, wind power production is expected to be low, contributing to the price increase.
