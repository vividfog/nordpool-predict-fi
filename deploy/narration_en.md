In the overall view for the week, prices will mostly settle at a low level, often clearly below 4–5 cents. An exception will appear at the start of the week, as the average on Monday rises to 7,4 cents and a single hour reaches 13,4 cents. On other days, averages will stay lower and intraday variation will be more moderate.

**On Monday** a risk of price spikes is forecast for individual hours. The highest level will occur in the late morning, roughly 9–11. The day’s high maximum is partly explained by the low wind-power minimum, which falls to 1 726 megawatts. This is clearly lower than on other days and coincides with the elevated peak.

**On Sunday** the price level will be the week’s lowest, with an average of 0,7 cents and a maximum of 2,7 cents. **On Wednesday** and **on Saturday** prices will largely stay around 1–2 cents. **Thursday’s** and **Friday’s** averages will hover near 2,5 cents, with limited intraday variation. **On Tuesday** the average will reach 4,2 cents, but intraday levels will remain clearly below Monday’s.

The week’s low price level will be supported by abundant wind power on most days, averaging over 3 000 megawatts. As a result, the cheapest periods will typically fall at night and over the weekend. The priciest moments will concentrate in weekday mornings and evenings, but Monday’s late morning will stand out as the only time clearly exceeding 10 cents.
