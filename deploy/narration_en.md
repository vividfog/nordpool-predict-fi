The week’s price outlook is expected to be twofold. On **Tuesday**, **Wednesday**, and **Thursday** the average will be high (10,8–13,5 ¢), and individual peaks will exceed 15 ¢. Wednesday stands out most: an average of 13,5 ¢ and a daily high of 22,8 ¢, most likely at 08:00–10:00. Tuesday’s peak is expected around 18:00–20:00 (max 18,8 ¢) and Thursday’s at 16:00–18:00 (max 22,0 ¢). These higher hourly prices are explained by low minimum wind output on the same days (Wednesday as low as 483 MW, Thursday 622 MW, and Tuesday 1035 MW), which often lifts peak hours. Friday’s peak will most likely occur at 08:00–10:00 (max 14,7 ¢).

The end of the week will be clearly cheaper. On **Saturday**, a public holiday will lighten demand and support lower levels; a single peak may land at 10:00–12:00 (max 8,0 ¢). On **Sunday**, prices will remain low across the board, with the day’s high likely at 16:00–18:00 (max 4,9 ¢). Next **Monday** the average price will drop to 2,4 cents and the lowest hour may be negative (around 02:00–04:00), making it the cheapest day of the week.
