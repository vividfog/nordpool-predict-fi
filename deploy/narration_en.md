*Electricity prices will fluctuate in the coming week, ranging from affordable levels to high peaks, especially at the beginning and end of the week, as low wind power production and maintenance outages affect forecasts.*

**In the Loviisa 1** nuclear power plant, maintenance is ongoing, which began on September 6, 2025, at 10:00 and is expected to end on September 24, 2025, at 00:00. **Loviisa 2** is also undergoing maintenance, starting on August 17, 2025, at 04:00 and ending on September 17, 2025, at 16:00. The maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of the forecast, as training data from periods of maintenance is limited.

The forecast was updated on Monday at 21:10.

During the upcoming week, electricity prices will vary significantly. **Tuesday** and **Saturday** are forecasted to be the most affordable days, with average prices below two cents. On Tuesday, prices are expected to remain low for most of the day but may rise in the evening, reaching over eight cents. **Wednesday** and **Thursday** will see relatively higher prices, with Thursday posing a high risk for price spikes, particularly in the afternoon. On Wednesday, wind power production will be at its lowest, potentially increasing prices.

**Friday** offers a moderate price level without significant spikes, while **Sunday** is expected to maintain low prices throughout the day. Wind power production on Sunday is slightly below average but is not anticipated to have a substantial effect on the price level.

Next **Monday** stands out as the most expensive day of the week, with prices potentially reaching up to 25 cents per kWh. This is partly due to low wind power production and maintenance outages in nuclear power plants, which may affect the forecast's accuracy. On Monday, price spikes are expected particularly during morning and evening hours.
