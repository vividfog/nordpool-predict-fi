The coming week presents interesting price variations in the electricity market. **Tuesday** stands out particularly with its highest maximum price, which could rise to 29.7 cents. This may be due to the low wind power minimum production, which remains at 832 MW. **Wednesday** and **Thursday** are expected to see significant price fluctuations, with both days having a high risk of price spikes.

**Friday**, on the other hand, offers lower prices, with an average price of only 7.2 cents. **Saturday** and **Sunday** prices are the most affordable of the week. Sunday, in particular, stands out with an affordable average price of only 3.7 cents. This is partly due to strong wind power production, averaging 1824 MW on Sunday.

**Next Monday**, prices are expected to rise again, as the maximum price could reach 17 cents. The affordable price level over the weekend, however, might provide opportunities for cost-conscious consumers.
