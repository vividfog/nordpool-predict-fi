*Electricity prices for the upcoming week will generally remain moderate, but on Thursday prices are expected to rise significantly compared to other days, with high hourly price spikes anticipated during the morning hours; by the weekend, prices will return to lower levels, briefly even dipping into negative territory.*

Olkiluoto 2 nuclear power plant is undergoing a maintenance outage that began on 25 May 2025 at 18:00 and is expected to end on 23 June 2025 at 19:00. Olkiluoto 3 is experiencing reduced output, with available capacity at 1060 MW compared to its nominal 1600 MW. The reduced production started on 23 June 2025 at 06:00 and is forecasted to end on 25 June 2025 at 01:00. The ongoing maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of price forecasts, as the training dataset during maintenance periods is limited.

The coming week's electricity price development will be relatively variable. Daily average prices will mostly remain around or below three cents. However, on **Thursday**, prices are expected to rise notably. The day's expected average price will climb to 6.7 cents, and the maximum price could reach a high level of over 13 cents during the morning hours between 7:00 and 9:00. On Thursday, wind power production will also remain low, at times dropping to about 438 MW, partially explaining the elevated maximum price.

The week's lowest average electricity price will occur on **Saturday**, when electricity will cost less than one cent per kilowatt-hour on average. Additionally, negative prices as low as -0.9 cents are forecasted in the early morning hours. Negative prices will also appear during the nights preceding Wednesday and next Monday, when electricity production briefly exceeds consumption.

On other days, prices will remain moderate. Daily maximum prices will rarely exceed five cents, and significant price spikes are not anticipated. Nonetheless, slightly higher prices may occur during certain hours, particularly morning and evening. For example, on **Tuesday**, prices around five cents per kilowatt-hour are expected between 18:00 and 20:00.

Toward the end of the week, price fluctuations will level out somewhat. Sunday's expected average price is two cents, with the day's highest price just above three cents, relatively moderate within the week's context.

When observing the price developments for the upcoming week, it is important to note the reduced production and maintenance outage at the Olkiluoto nuclear power plants. These factors could introduce slight uncertainties into the forecast, causing actual prices to differ from current predictions.
