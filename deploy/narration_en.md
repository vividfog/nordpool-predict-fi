The week’s price outlook will be mixed. Higher daily averages are expected from **Tuesday** to **Thursday** (11,3–12,4 ¢), as wind power will remain low. In particular, on **Wednesday** minimum wind output will drop to 581 MW, which explains the week’s highest hourly price at 23,7 ¢ and lifts the daily average to 12,4 ¢. The weekend will ease: **Saturday** is a public holiday and the average will fall to 3,4 ¢, and on **Sunday** the price will stay very low at 0,2 ¢ on average; the lowest hour will dip to −0,6 ¢. Also **Monday’s** 4,3 ¢ will remain moderate, supported by strong wind.

Individual spikes are anticipated on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. Tuesday’s highest hour will likely fall around 17:00–19:00. On Wednesday the peak will be seen in the morning, 07:00–09:00. On Thursday the increases will be concentrated around 16:00–18:00. On Friday the morning will stand out, 08:00–10:00. Saturday also carries a noted spike risk, most likely at 08:00–10:00. Sunday will stay near zero all day without notable surges.
