On **Tuesday**, electricity prices rise slightly but remain reasonable. On **Wednesday**, prices are expected to rise above five cents, setting it higher than the week's average. **Thursday** may see price spikes, as the maximum price might exceed 15 cents, particularly during morning and evening hours when wind power production is at its lowest.

**Friday** stands out as the most expensive day of the week. The average price is forecasted to rise above ten cents, and price spikes are possible during individual hours when wind power production is at its lowest. On Saturday, the price level remains high, although slightly more affordable than Friday, with the maximum price reaching up to 22.7 cents.

The week's price trend is highlighted by the fluctuation in wind power production, which, along with nuclear plant maintenance, may affect the predictability of prices.
