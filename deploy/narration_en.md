Electricity prices in the upcoming week will generally remain affordable. Average daily prices will fluctuate around three to four cents per kilowatt-hour on weekdays, while the weekend will bring significantly lower price expectations. The cheapest moments of the week will occur on **Saturday**, with an average price of just 0,2 cents and even negative prices during certain hours.

The week's highest hourly price, 10,9 cents, will occur on Monday evening between 19:00 and 21:00. **Monday‚Äôs** price forecast thus includes an elevated risk of individual price spikes, particularly in the evening hours. Likewise, **Wednesday** and **Thursday** carry a risk of occasional price spikes, with highest prices occurring during morning hours. On **Friday**, the highest price will reach 8,0 cents between 8:00 and 10:00 in the morning, typically a time of high energy demand.

The price level will clearly drop over the weekend. On **Saturday**, prices will turn negative for several hours from the afternoon well into the night. The lowest hourly price on Saturday evening, between 21:00 and 23:00, will be -1,0 cents. Prices will remain low on Sunday as well, though there is still a risk of short-lived price spikes.

Variations in wind power production partly explain the price differences throughout the week. On **Thursday** and **Friday**, wind power output will remain weak on average, contributing slightly to higher average prices. Although **Saturday** is the cheapest day of the week, wind power production will also fluctuate significantly then, causing hourly price variations.

Nevertheless, the overall weekly outlook remains moderate, without major fluctuations in average prices. Even though hourly prices occasionally rise, daily averages should mostly remain affordable.
