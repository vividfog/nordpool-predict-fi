| **Friday** | 3,1 | -0,1 - 7,1 | 2320 - 5678 | 1,3 |
| **Saturday** | 1,3 | 0,3 - 2,5 | 3521 - 7214 | 1,2 |
| **Sunday** | 2,3 | 0,9 - 4,4 | 3466 - 7280 | -0,2 |

| **Tuesday** | 5,2 | 1,5 - 7,7 | 4295 - 6012 | -3,0 |
| **Wednesday** | 4,9 | 1,1 - 9,4 | 3446 - 5957 | -4,7 |
| **Thursday** | 11,9 | 6,1 - 18,1 | 2072 - 3802 | -7,0 |

The weekly price picture will be split. The public holiday on **Friday** will ease demand, and the level will stay low. A night-time exception will also be seen: around 00:00–02:00 prices will briefly dip negative (-0,1 ¢). On **Saturday** the level will be the week’s lowest (avg 1,3 ¢), and strong wind will support the cheapness. On Sunday prices will remain below four cents. At the start of the week Monday will stay moderate, but on **Tuesday** and **Wednesday** averages will rise closer to five cents, while still remaining clearly below ten.

The clear outlier will be **Thursday**, which will be a public holiday yet the most expensive day: the average will be 11,9 ¢ and the day’s high 18,1 ¢. Severe cold (-7,0 °C) will support the elevated level. A pronounced risk of hourly spikes will be projected for Thursday. The highest hour will likely fall in the evening, around 17:00–19:00. Daytime will also remain well above average for long stretches, so Thursday will stand out from the other days.
