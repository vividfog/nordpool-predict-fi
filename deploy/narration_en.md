In the upcoming week's electricity price forecast, significant fluctuations are expected. **Friday's** average price is relatively high at 11.5 ¬¢/kWh, with prices ranging from 2.1 to 16.5 cents throughout the day. Wind power production is generally low at this time, which may explain the higher price levels. On **Saturday**, electricity is forecasted to be cheaper with an average price of only 3.7 ¬¢/kWh, though there is a risk of price spikes during individual hours. Sunday's forecast shows a slightly higher average price of 4.8 ¬¢/kWh, with the possibility of price spikes also present.

On **Monday**, the average price rises to 6.0 cents, with prices expected to range from 1.9 to 10.8 cents. **Tuesday's** forecast predicts an average price of 5.0 ¬¢/kWh, and wind power production is relatively high, which could curb price increases. On **Wednesday**, the average price rises again to 8.2 cents, and the maximum price could reach 13.5 cents.

Towards the end of the week, on **Thursday**, prices remain high, with an average price forecasted at 7.8 ¬¢/kWh, while the day's highest price could reach 15.9 cents. With wind power production at its lowest around 938 MW, the risk of price spikes is particularly high.
