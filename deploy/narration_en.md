In the coming week, electricity prices will vary significantly on different days. **Wednesday** is expected to see the highest prices of the week, with low wind power production, especially in the morning and evening, potentially pushing prices up to 28 cents per kilowatt-hour. This makes Wednesday the most expensive day of the week.

On Thursday, prices will drop, but there is a risk of price spikes during certain hours due to weak wind power. Friday and Saturday are expected to be the cheapest days, as ample wind power availability will lower prices to as low as 1.3 cents. 

Sunday's prices will remain low, and on Monday, prices are expected to rise slightly, but not reaching Wednesday's levels. Wind power production on Monday will be variable, possibly causing price spikes during the morning hours. Tuesday's prices will remain close to Monday's levels without significant deviations.

The cheapest moments of the week will occur on Friday and Sunday, while Wednesday will be the most expensive day. Variations in wind power production, however, add their own excitement, particularly to the price developments at the beginning of the week.
