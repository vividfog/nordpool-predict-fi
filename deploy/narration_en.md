The period will open with low prices on **Thursday**. The average is expected at 1,8 ¢ with a 0,2–3,7 ¢ range. Ample wind generation (4206–5873 MW) will keep prices down. The cheapest hours are expected overnight and into the early morning, with several hours below one cent.

**Friday** will see the average rise to 10,7 ¢. The day’s peak would fall around 10:00–12:00, with the 11:00 hour reaching 21,3 ¢. Wind output will dip to a 629 MW minimum, which helps explain the clearly higher maximum price during weak production. Several late-morning hours are projected above 15 ¢.

**On Saturday** the expected average is 10,8 ¢, with a single peak around 08:00–10:00 near 17,4 ¢. Intraday swings will again be tied to weak wind (minimum 785 MW). **On Sunday** conditions will settle: the average will be 4,5 ¢ with a 3,2–6,2 ¢ range. Strengthening production will push prices lower.

**On Monday** the average will be 11,0 ¢, with an evening peak around 18:00–20:00 as the 19:00 hour reaches 20,9 ¢. The wind minimum will stay at 976 MW, keeping the spike risk elevated. **On Tuesday** and **Wednesday** prices will return to more moderate levels, with averages of 6,1 and 6,9 ¢ as wind is stronger. The week’s cheapest moments will fall in the Thursday overnight and early-morning hours, while the most expensive windows will be Friday 10:00–12:00 and Monday 18:00–20:00. Price expectations may still shift, especially if the wind forecast updates.
