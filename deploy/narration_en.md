In the coming days, electricity exchange prices will experience significant variation. The price range will be wide, with both negative prices and sharp individual price spikes occurring within the week. **Saturday** will stand out prominently, with an expected daily average price of 5.2 cents and a maximum hourly price rising as high as 19.0 cents.

On Saturday morning, around 7‚Äì9 AM, the electricity price is forecasted to peak. This spike will likely relate to very low wind power production at that time. Wind power will drop to a minimum of around 191 MW, significantly lower than typical levels, partly explaining the high price.

The week's lowest electricity prices will occur on **Sunday**, when the day's average price will be negative at -0.5 cents. Negative prices will persist for several consecutive hours, especially in the early morning and around midday, between 12‚Äì3 PM. This indicates abundant supply combined with modest consumption on that day.

On both **Monday** and **Tuesday**, average electricity prices will remain low, around 1.2 cents each day. However, the price range will still be relatively wide, with some hours dipping into negative territory. On Tuesday, in the very early morning hours around 3‚Äì5 AM, electricity prices will temporarily drop below zero.

Wednesday and Thursday prices will be moderate, although Thursday's daily average price will rise slightly above other weekdays, reaching 2.3 cents. Prices on Thursday evening, around 6‚Äì8 PM, will exceed five cents. On the last day of the week, Friday, the average electricity price will again decrease, reaching about 1.3 cents.

While awaiting a week characterized by varying electricity prices, consumers should bear in mind that individual price spikes may occur, especially on Saturday morning and occasionally on other days as well.
