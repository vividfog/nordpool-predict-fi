*Next week, electricity prices on the stock market will vary significantly, influenced by wind power production and price spikes, especially on weekdays. The weekend offers affordable electricity opportunities, but on Wednesday, prices reach their peak.*

Electricity prices will fluctuate somewhat between different days next week. **On Saturday** and **Sunday**, prices will remain particularly low, even negative, due to strong wind power production. During these days, wind power production is at a high level, which helps keep prices down.

Next **Monday**, prices will rise significantly from the weekend levels, with the day's average price expected to be 4.2 cents per kilowatt-hour. There is also a possibility of spikes during individual hours, particularly in the afternoon. **On Tuesday**, prices remain at the same level, but the predicted maximum price rises to 11.9 cents. Wind power production is slightly lower then, which may explain the expected price increase.

**On Wednesday**, prices are at their highest, with the average price expected to be 7.6 cents. This is partly due to the low wind power production, which remains below 2039 megawatts. Additionally, the hourly maximum price reaches 14.1 cents, which may raise concerns about price spikes. **On Thursday**, prices decrease, with an expected average of 3.9 cents. Wind power production is higher again, which may stabilize price developments.

As the week ends next **Friday**, prices continue to drop, with an expected average price of 2.9 cents. Wind power production remains at a reasonable level, which helps keep prices low. The weekend offers affordable moments for electricity consumers, while weekdays, especially Wednesday, bring higher prices.
