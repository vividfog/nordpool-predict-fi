*In next week's electricity price forecast, Thursday's high prices stand out due to low wind power production, while cheaper prices are expected on Sunday due to stronger winds.*

The Loviisa 2 nuclear plant is under maintenance from 17 August 2025 at 04:00 until 6 September 2025 at 00:00. This may affect the accuracy of the electricity price forecast, as there is limited training data available for periods of maintenance.

In the upcoming week's forecast, electricity prices are expected to be quite variable. **Thursday** is expected to see the highest prices of the week, with the average price rising to 5.5 cents and the maximum price potentially reaching 13 cents. This may be due to Thursday's lowest wind power production, forecasted at only 508 MW. **Friday's** average price is also elevated at 4.4 cents, but wind power production is slightly higher.

The most affordable prices of the week are expected on **Sunday**, with an average price of only 1.0 ¬¢/kWh and a minimum price that may even drop into the negative at -0.4 cents. This is partly due to higher wind power production, which could reach up to 3209 MW.

**Wednesday** and **Saturday** both present a moderate risk of price spikes, particularly during the morning and evening hours as wind power fluctuates and demand may rise. On **Monday**, however, the risk of price spikes is minimal, even though the maximum price may reach 9.6 cents.

The week appears to contain many price fluctuations, but the most significant differences are concentrated at the beginning and end of the week. This offers consumers the opportunity to take advantage of cheaper prices, especially over the weekend and on Sunday.
