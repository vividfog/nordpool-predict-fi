Price development will be variable. The most notable will be **Friday**, with an average price of 15,0 ¢ and a daily high of 25,7 ¢. Wind output will be very low then (min 288 MW), which explains the elevated level. The risk of spikes in individual hours will be pronounced, with the peak likely around 17:00–19:00. **Saturday** will be a public holiday, which will ease demand and push prices down. Even so, a single morning slot could spike, most likely around 08:00–10:00. **Sunday** will stay clearly lower, and the cheapest night hours will likely fall around 00:00–02:00.

At the start of the week, the level will rise. **Monday** will remain mid-range on average, without spike risk. **Tuesday** will edge toward the expensive range (avg 9,5 ¢) and will carry a clear spike risk; the highest hour will likely occur around 10:00–12:00 (15,7 ¢), and a low wind minimum (1172 MW) will support the rise. **Wednesday** will return close to the cheap range. **Thursday** will average 9,0 ¢ with no separate spike risk.
