*Electricity price expectations for the week fluctuate but generally remain moderate. On Tuesday and Friday, the risk of price spikes is significant, while Saturday and Sunday are expected to have more favorable prices. Wind power production partially influences these price variations.*

Loviisa 1 nuclear power plant is undergoing maintenance, which started on 6.9.2025 at 10:00 and is expected to end on 24.9.2025 at 00:00. This maintenance may affect the forecast's accuracy, as training data from maintenance periods is limited.

During the week, electricity price expectations vary somewhat, but not dramatically. **Tuesday** stands out with the highest forecasted maximum price, reaching 15.6 ¬¢. This is partly due to fluctuations in wind power, as the day's minimum production is at the level of 2085 megawatts. **Friday**, on the other hand, is the most expensive day of the week, with an average price of 8.6 ¬¢. This may be partly explained by the lower average wind power production, which remains at 2067 megawatts.

On **Saturday** and **Sunday**, there is a risk of price spikes during individual hours, but the average price remains affordable at 3.6 ¬¢ on both days. **Monday**'s prices are still relatively low, with no expected price spikes. **Wednesday** forecasts negative prices early in the morning, which may offer temporary savings opportunities for consumers.

As the week progresses, **Thursday** is expected to have moderate price development despite the peak price of 15.9 ¬¢, as wind power production is forecasted to be strong, averaging at a level of 3081 megawatts.
