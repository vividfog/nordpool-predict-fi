The approaching week seems variable in terms of prices, but no major anomalies are expected. **Saturday** stands out slightly with its higher average price of 3.0 cents. This day may also contain price spikes, particularly during the afternoon and evening. **Monday** is forecasted to be a bit more expensive as well, with an average price of 3.4 cents, possibly due to low wind power production during the morning and evening.

**Tuesday** appears to be the cheapest day of the week, with an average price of 1.4 cents. This could be attributed to strong wind power, which is at a high level and may lower electricity prices. This day also presents a chance for negative prices, which is rare but possible.

**Wednesday** and **Thursday** maintain more stable prices, with an average of 2.8 cents. Both days may include individual price spikes, but they are not expected to be significant according to the forecast. Towards the end of the week, **Thursday's** wind power production is predicted to be high, which may help stabilize price fluctuations.

Overall, the forecast suggests the week will be moderately priced, and no significant deviations are anticipated unless unexpected changes occur in wind power.
