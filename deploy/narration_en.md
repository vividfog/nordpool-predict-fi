Next **Wednesday**, electricity prices are expected to be the highest of the week, with an average price of 11.6 cents per kilowatt-hour. During the day, prices may fluctuate significantly, as the maximum price reaches up to 29.6 cents. This may be due to low wind power production, which is at a minimum of 1109 MW.

On **Thursday**, the average price drops to 5.7 cents, but there is a risk of price spikes. This is due to the large variation in wind power, although the average temperature remains stable at 11.1 degrees. **Friday** sees the lowest prices, with an average of only 2.5 cents. Wind power production remains strong, which partly explains the low prices.

**Saturday** and **Sunday** have extremely low average electricity prices, 0.1 and 0.8 cents, respectively. There is plenty of wind power, and minimum prices are negative, making the weekend particularly affordable for electricity consumers.

Next **Monday**, the average electricity price rises slightly to 4.6 cents. Wind power production varies but remains at a reasonable level. **Tuesday's** price forecast shows another increase, with an average of 9.6 cents. There is a high risk of price spikes, and wind power production is low. This could significantly raise the prices for individual hours above the forecast.
