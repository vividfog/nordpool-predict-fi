Prices will vary notably. **On Friday**, the average will reach 16.6 ¢ and the day’s peak 26.4 ¢ at 16:00–18:00. Over the weekend, prices will ease: **on Saturday** the average will be 8.5 ¢ and **on Sunday** 6.4 ¢, with the cheapest hour around 13:00–15:00 (down to 4.4 ¢). **On Monday** the level will be 9.7 ¢. Midweek, prices will tighten again: **on Tuesday** the average will be 15.3 ¢ and **on Wednesday** 15.4 ¢, with peaks reaching 24.6 ¢ and 22.6 ¢. **On Thursday**, the average will settle at 12.3 ¢.

Spike risk will appear on several days. The highest risk will focus on **Friday’s** and **Tuesday’s** evening hours at 16:00–18:00, and on **Wednesday** morning at 08:00–10:00. **On Monday**, a spike is also anticipated in the morning at 08:00–10:00. **On Saturday**, risks will fall in the evening at 19:00–21:00, and **on Sunday** at 18:00–20:00. **On Thursday**, pressure will target the evening at 16:00–18:00. Friday’s and Tuesday’s exceptionally high peaks will be explained in part by very low wind minima (Friday 536 MW, Tuesday 666 MW) and low average output, which supports higher prices during those hours.
