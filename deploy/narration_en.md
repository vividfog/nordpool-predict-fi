This week's electricity price forecast shows significant daily variation. Generally, the week offers mostly affordable or moderate pricing, but midweek prices rise notably higher.

The most affordable days are clearly during the weekend. On **Saturday**, the average electricity price will drop below one cent per kilowatt-hour, to 0.8 cents, and minimum prices during nighttime and daytime hours will even dip negative. On **Sunday**, prices will remain very low, also briefly slipping into negative territory, with an average daily price of 1.2 ¬¢. The cheapest hours during the weekend will occur around midday on **Saturday** between 11:00‚Äì13:00 and on **Sunday** afternoon between 14:00‚Äì16:00.

The highest price peak of the week will occur on **Wednesday**, when the average daily price rises to 6.4 ¬¢/kWh and the maximum hourly price will reach as high as 15.9 ¬¢ in the morning between 07:00‚Äì09:00. Wednesday's significantly lower minimum wind power production (only 320 MW) during the most expensive morning hours explains this elevated price level. Therefore, the risk of price spikes is significant during these early morning hours.

On **Thursday** and **Friday** as well, maximum prices will momentarily rise relatively high, around 9‚Äì11 cents, particularly in the morning hours between approximately 07:00‚Äì09:00. On both days, wind power production will remain relatively low, contributing temporarily to higher prices.

On **Monday**, pricing will again settle to a moderate level, with an average price of 4.2 ¬¢, and no particularly high price peaks are expected throughout the day. Wind power fluctuations will stay within normal ranges, without any noteworthy anomalies expected in price formation.
