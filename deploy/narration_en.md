*Significant price fluctuations are expected in next week's electricity market as wind power production varies and several days face potential price spikes, particularly on Friday and Wednesday.*

The Loviisa 1 nuclear power plant is undergoing maintenance, which began on September 6, 2025, at 10:00 AM and is expected to end on September 24, 2025, at 12:00 AM. Loviisa 2 is also under maintenance from August 17, 2025, at 4:00 AM to September 18, 2025, at 2:00 PM. These maintenance periods may affect the accuracy of the forecast, as training data from such periods is limited.

**Friday's** prices will be significantly higher this coming week, with an average price of 13.4 ¢/kWh. Forecasts suggest price peaks reaching up to 27.4 ¢/kWh on Friday, possibly due to low wind power production, averaging just 396 MW. On Saturday, prices will drop significantly, with an average of only 3.1 ¢/kWh, though isolated price spikes may occur throughout the day.

**Sunday** and **Monday** will see moderate prices, with averages of 4.0 ¢ and 4.8 ¢/kWh. Wind power production increases on these days, partly explaining the price decrease. **Tuesday** will offer the lowest forecasted prices, with an average of 2.7 ¢/kWh and strong wind power production.

**Wednesday** forecasts high price spikes, with the peak potentially reaching 20.6 ¢/kWh. This unusual price fluctuation may be due to variations in wind power production throughout the day. On Thursday, prices remain high, with an average of 7.2 ¢/kWh, and price spikes may occur.
