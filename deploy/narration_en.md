The electricity price forecast for the upcoming week will show clear variation between days. The week will begin with slightly higher price levels but will end at quite affordable rates.

On **Monday**, the average price will be 4.9 cents per kilowatt-hour, and the day will feature the week's highest single-hour price, reaching up to 10 cents in the evening around 7‚Äì9 PM. The morning hours, approximately 8‚Äì10 AM, will also be notable with prices exceeding five cents. It should also be noted that there will be a risk of individual hourly price spikes on Monday.

**Tuesday** will be slightly more expensive than Monday, with the daily average rising to 5.1 cents. The highest prices of the day will occur in the morning around 8‚Äì10 AM, peaking at 9.3 cents around 9 AM. There will also be a risk of individual hourly price spikes on Tuesday.

On **Wednesday**, prices will decrease slightly, with an average price of 4.2 cents. The day's highest price, 8.1 cents, will occur around 8‚Äì10 AM, approximately at 9 AM. The possibility of hourly price spikes for individual hours will remain on Wednesday.

**Thursday's** average price will further decrease slightly to 3.8 cents. The highest prices of the day (7.4 ¬¢) will be experienced in the morning around 8‚Äì10 AM. There will still be a risk of individual hourly price spikes on Thursday.

As the week progresses, price levels will clearly decrease: on **Friday**, the average price will drop to 2.7 cents, and on **Saturday**, it will be just above one cent. Saturday will also see the week's lowest individual hourly price, dropping into negative territory (-0.7 ¬¢) early in the morning around 4‚Äì6 AM.

The weekly price variations are partly explained by fluctuations in wind power. Particularly on Tuesday, the minimum wind power (180 MW) will be very low, partially explaining the day's high price peaks. Saturday's very low prices will be supported by the week's highest average wind power production.
