| **Saturday** | 12,2 | 5,3 - 22,2 | 875 - 4272 | 5,2 |
| **Sunday** | 5,5 | 2,9 - 8,4 | 4342 - 5726 | 4,7 |

| **Wednesday** | 2,7 | 1,4 - 5,1 | 4243 - 5129 | 5,0 |
| **Thursday** | 3,6 | 1,1 - 6,9 | 2697 - 4424 | 6,3 |

The week’s price trend will clearly split in two. The highest averages will fall on **Saturday** (12,2 ¢) and **Monday** (11,4 ¢), whereas in the latter half of the week the averages will drop to the 3,6–1,6 ¢ range. The clearest outlier of the week will be Saturday’s high maximum price, 22,2 ¢.

The risk of price spikes will stand out in individual hours over the weekend and early week. On **Saturday**, the peak will land in the morning at 08:00–10:00 (max 22,2 ¢). The day’s minimum wind output will fall to 875 MW, which helps explain the higher peak compared with other days. On **Monday**, the peak will occur in the evening at 18:00–20:00 (max 20,2 ¢). On **Tuesday**, the spike risk will center on the morning at 08:00–10:00 (max 19,1 ¢).

By contrast, on **Sunday** the average price will hold around 5,5 ¢ and the daily range will stay within 2,9–8,4 ¢. On **Wednesday**, the spread will narrow to 1,4–5,1 ¢, and on **Thursday** it will remain within 1,1–6,9 ¢. **Friday** is expected to be the week’s cheapest day with a 1,6 ¢ average; intraday variation will remain at 0,8–3,2 ¢. The week’s cheapest hours will likely land early Friday morning at 03:00–05:00, dipping to 0,8 ¢.

Strong wind above 3000 MW will support a low price level especially from Wednesday to Friday. Sunday’s average wind output (5075 MW) will also be high, aligning with the moderate price level. This forecast is based on the current wind and market outlook, so realized prices may still change if production conditions shift.
