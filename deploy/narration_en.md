*Next week, electricity prices will vary significantly between days due to the influence of wind power production and other factors. Price spikes are particularly expected on Sunday, while the lowest prices of the week are anticipated on Saturday and Friday.*

There is an ongoing maintenance outage at the Loviisa 1 nuclear power plant, which started on 6.9.2025 at 10:00 and is expected to end on 24.9.2025 at 00:00. Loviisa 2 is also under maintenance, beginning on 17.8.2025 at 04:00 and expected to finish on 17.9.2025 at 00:00. These maintenance outages can affect forecast accuracy because there is limited training data available from periods with maintenance outages.

The forecast was updated on Friday at 14:25.

The price forecasts for the coming week indicate fluctuating electricity costs. **Saturday** will start the week with a low average price of about 1.4 cents per kilowatt-hour, but the price range will vary between 0.4 and 6.1 cents. This is partly due to the abundant wind power production, which will be at a strong average level.

**Sunday** stands out with its higher average price of 4.5 cents and a significant maximum price that could reach up to 17.6 cents. This is due to the reduced wind power production, with a minimum that could drop below 600 MW. There is a high risk of price spikes on Sunday, especially in the evening between 18:00 and 20:00.

**Monday** and **Tuesday** will bring more moderate price developments, with average prices at 2.4 and 3.6 cents. During these days, wind power production will remain relatively stable, and no price spikes are expected.

**Wednesday** sees slightly higher prices with an average of 3.9 cents, but wind power production will remain at a reasonable level. Price expectations are stable without significant spikes.

**Thursday**â€™s price forecasts rise again, with an average price of 5.3 cents, and the maximum price could reach 9.8 cents. The lower minimum wind power production partly explains the higher price level. Price spikes may occur in the morning between 07:00 and 09:00.

**Friday** concludes the week with relatively low prices, with an average price of 2.5 cents. Wind power production is expected to be strong, which partly supports the lower prices.
