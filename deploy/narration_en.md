Price differences will widen toward the end of the week and early next week. **Thursday’s** average is projected at 2.7 ¢, staying low thanks to abundant wind output. **Friday’s** average will be 8.6 ¢.

The week’s most expensive days will land at the beginning of next week. **Monday’s** average will be 11.1 ¢, with an evening peak of 18.1 ¢ at 17:00–19:00 as the wind minimum is only 886 MW. **Tuesday** will stand out most: a 12.5 ¢ average and a morning high of 22.3 ¢ at 08:00–10:00, with a 994 MW wind minimum. **Wednesday** will return to clearly more moderate levels, averaging 4.8 ¢.
