In the upcoming week, electricity price forecasts show considerable variation. **Tuesday** stands out with a high average price of 8.7 Â¢/kWh and significant price spikes expected to reach up to 20.2 Â¢/kWh. This is partly due to the low wind power production, predicted to be at a minimum of 796 MW.

On **Wednesday**, prices are expected to decrease significantly, with an average price forecasted at 4.3 Â¢/kWh. No significant price spikes are anticipated for this day, and wind power production is expected to be strong. **Thursday** sees a slight rise in prices, with a risk of price spikes, as the maximum price may reach 13.8 Â¢/kWh.

**Friday** and **Saturday** have similar average prices, at 6.5 and 6.6 Â¢/kWh. Price spikes might occur, particularly on **Friday evening**, when wind power production could be low. On **Sunday**, price spikes are possible, with the maximum price predicted to rise to 15.0 Â¢/kWh.

Next **Monday** is forecasted to have the highest prices of the week, with an average price rising to 12.6 Â¢/kWh and a maximum price reaching up to 24.2 Â¢/kWh. This is due to low wind power production, which may cause price spikes, especially during morning and evening hours.
