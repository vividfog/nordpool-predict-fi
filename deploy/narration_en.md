Prices will vary markedly over the week. **On Friday**, the sharpest peak of the week is expected, up to 27,6 ¢ at 17:00–19:00. **On Tuesday**, another strong evening spike will likely appear, around 24,2 ¢ at 16:00–18:00, and **on Wednesday** a morning peak will reach 23,1 ¢ at 08:00–10:00. These are accentuated by very low minimum wind output: Friday 378 MW, Tuesday 712 MW and Wednesday 1142 MW, which explains the elevated maximum prices. Also **on Monday**, the spike risk will focus on the morning, around 08:00–10:00, with a top price of 15,0 ¢.

The most affordable periods will fall on the weekend and late week. **On Saturday**, the average price will sink to 7,9 ¢, and **on Thursday** to 8,7 ¢; both are supported by strong wind (on average over 3000 MW). **On Sunday**, the average will stay moderate at 6,7 ¢, but isolated spikes may occur in the early evening, around 18:00–20:00, up to 10,3 ¢. The cheapest hours will likely occur on Sunday afternoon at 13:00–15:00, when the price dips to about 3,9 ¢.
