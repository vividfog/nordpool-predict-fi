The upcoming week brings varying electricity price expectations, with particularly high prices expected on **Saturday**. Saturday's average price rises to 13.7 cents, and peak prices could reach up to 25.9 ¢, partly due to weak average wind power production of just 455 MW. Saturday's price spikes may occur during morning and evening hours.

On **Sunday**, prices are forecasted to decrease significantly, with an average price of only 3.8 ¢. This is partly due to abundant wind power production, averaging 1884 MW. Similarly, low prices are expected on Monday, with an average of 2.6 cents. No significant price spikes are anticipated on Monday.

As the week progresses, prices are expected to rise again on **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**. Tuesday's average price is 6.0 ¢, but price spikes may occur during morning and evening hours. On Wednesday, the average price rises to 8.2 cents, with peak prices potentially reaching 17.8 ¢, partly due to fluctuating wind power production and the impact of the maintenance shutdown.

Finally, on **Thursday**, prices are expected to be more moderate, with an average price of 4.8 ¢. However, price spikes may still occur during the day, so consumers should remain vigilant.
