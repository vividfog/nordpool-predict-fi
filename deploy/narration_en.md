According to the forecasts, electricity prices will show some variation over the coming week. On **Thursday** and **Friday**, price expectations are lower, with the average price around 3 cents. On both days, wind power production remains relatively high, helping to keep prices reasonable. On **Saturday** and **Sunday**, average prices remain moderate, but Sunday is expected to see a price spike in the evening, with electricity prices potentially rising to 8 cents.

On **Monday**, electricity prices increase slightly, with an average price of 4.6 cents. This is partly due to lower wind power production and a higher maximum price, which can reach up to 10 cents. On **Tuesday**, prices remain at a similar level, with variable wind power production potentially affecting price expectations.

On **Wednesday**, prices decrease again, and wind power production remains at a relatively good level. This day stands out as affordable, with an average price of just 2.4 cents, and the risk of price spikes is minimal.

Throughout the week, electricity price expectations remain mostly low, but there may be variations within individual days, particularly during evening hours.
