The week will look generally inexpensive, as most daily averages will stay below four cents. Price spikes will nevertheless be flagged. On **Monday**, individual hourly increases will be likely around 07:00–09:00, with an intraday peak at 7,8 ¢. On **Thursday**, the risk of a peak will be clear around 17:00–19:00, when prices could exceed 15 ¢; the higher maximum, 16,6 ¢, would be explained by the low minimum wind output (928 MW). On **Sunday**, the week’s highest average, 7,8 ¢, will be expected, with potential peaks around 17:00–19:00 (maximum 17,0 ¢). It will be a public holiday, but the exceptionally low wind minimum (293 MW) would explain the elevated price and wide variation.

On **Tuesday**, the average will dip to 0,8 ¢, explained by strong wind. On **Wednesday** and Thursday, night and early-morning hours will briefly turn negative (as low as −0,2 ¢ and −0,3 ¢). On **Saturday**, the level will remain steady, with a 1,9 ¢ average, to which abundant wind will contribute. **Friday** will sit in between, with a 3,7 ¢ average and a 7,0 ¢ upper bound. The cheapest moments will occur broadly on Tuesday, while the most expensive hours will concentrate on Thursday and Sunday evening.
