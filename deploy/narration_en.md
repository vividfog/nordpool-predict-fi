According to the electricity price forecast for the upcoming week, prices are expected to vary significantly between days. **Monday** stands out with a higher average price of 3.6 cents/kWh and the highest maximum price at 6.7 cents. This is partly explained by the low average wind power production, which remains at 855 MW. Prices are expected to be at their highest at the beginning of the week.

**Tuesday** offers the cheapest prices of the week, with an average price of only 0.8 cents/kWh and minimum prices dipping into negative figures during the night hours. This is due to abundant wind power, reaching up to 2705 MW. In the middle of the week, on **Wednesday**, prices are expected to settle at an average of 1.8 cents/kWh, but there is a risk of price spikes in the evening hours when wind power decreases.

The weekend begins with moderate price levels on **Saturday** and **Sunday**, but both days carry the risk of price spikes. Saturday's average price is 1.9 cents/kWh, but the maximum price could rise to 5.8 cents in the evening. On Sunday, the average price is expected to be 2.2 cents/kWh, with a maximum price of 5 cents during the evening.

As the week concludes on **Thursday**, electricity prices continue at a moderate average of 2.6 cents. The highest prices may occur in the evening when wind power is at its lowest.
