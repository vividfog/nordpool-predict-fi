In the upcoming week's forecasts, electricity prices vary somewhat between different days. **Wednesday** is expected to have the highest average price of the week at 9.6 ¢/kWh, and the maximum price could rise up to 17.6 ¢/kWh. This is partly explained by the low minimum wind power production on that day, which is only 891 MW. **Thursday** stands out as the most expensive day, with an average price reaching 11.1 ¢/kWh and a maximum price of 19.7 ¢/kWh. This day is also among the windiest of the week, which may increase price volatility.

The most affordable prices are expected on **Monday**, with an average price of 5.9 ¢/kWh and a minimum price that could drop as low as 1.5 ¢/kWh. **Tuesday's** average price of 5.1 ¢/kWh is also relatively low, even though the maximum price could rise to 11.9 ¢/kWh. During the weekend, particularly on **Saturday**, prices remain moderate, with an average price of 5.5 ¢/kWh and a maximum price of 8.6 ¢/kWh.

Price spikes may occur particularly on **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, when the forecasted maximum price is high and wind power production may be low. During these days, electricity prices could rise significantly during morning or evening hours.
