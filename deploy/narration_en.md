The upcoming days' electricity price forecasts indicate significant variations. **Thursday**'s average price is the highest of the week at 15.3 ¢/kWh, with a maximum price potentially reaching 30.2 ¢/kWh. This predicted high price is partly explained by minimal wind power, with a minimum of just 353 MW. Price spikes may occur during morning and evening hours, particularly between 19:00 and 21:00.

On **Friday**, prices are expected to drop to an average of 9.5 ¢/kWh, but the risk of price spikes remains. The weekend days, **Saturday** and **Sunday**, are forecasted to be the most affordable, with prices staying below 10 ¢/kWh. Saturday's average price is especially low at 4.8 ¢/kWh, followed closely by Sunday at 5.4 ¢/kWh.

As the week begins on **Monday**, prices rise again, and Tuesday sees another peak, with the average price climbing to 10.4 ¢/kWh. Potential price spikes are forecasted for Tuesday evening between 19:00 and 21:00. On **Wednesday**, the average price remains high at 12.4 ¢/kWh, and the risk of price spikes continues into the evening.
