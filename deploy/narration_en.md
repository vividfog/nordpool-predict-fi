Prices will swing over the week. **Wednesday** will see the average rise to 15,2 cents and the daily high to 22,1 ¢. Behind this, exceptionally low wind generation is expected, averaging 845 MW. **Friday** is expected to bring the week’s highest hourly price, up to 23,6 ¢, even though the daily average will remain at 13,8 ¢. The cheapest day will be **Sunday**, with an average of 5,3 ¢ and night hours dipping to about 2–3 cents (02:00–04:00). Abundant wind, peaking above 5000 MW, will explain the low level. Thursday’s and Saturday’s averages are expected to stay at 10,4 and 7,7 cents. Tuesday’s average is expected at 13,0 and Monday’s at 10,8, clearly below Wednesday.

Spike risk is indicated for several days: **Thursday** would peak in the afternoon at 15:00–17:00 (forecast maximum 12,8 ¢). **Friday** will concentrate risks in the evening at 18:00–20:00. **Saturday** may see a spike in the late morning at 09:00–11:00, even though levels would stay below 10 ¢. **Monday** will stand out in the morning at 08:00–10:00 (maximum 17,2 ¢), and **Tuesday** will typically peak in the early evening at 16:00–18:00 (maximum 20,0 ¢). Friday’s pronounced maximum is explained by the low minimum wind output, 910 MW, which brings intraday variability.
