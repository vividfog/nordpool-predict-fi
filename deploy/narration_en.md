The electricity price forecast for the coming week indicates significant daily variations. The early part of the weekend will be distinctly more expensive than other days, whereas later in the week prices will be considerably cheaper.

The week's highest prices will occur on **Saturday**, when the expected maximum electricity price will exceed 17 cents. There is a high risk of price spikes particularly on Saturday morning around 8‚Äì10 am, when wind power production is forecasted to drop to its lowest point, only 119 MW. On **Friday** as well, there is a risk of price spikes especially in the evening between 7‚Äì9 pm, when electricity prices may rise above 15 cents.

However, electricity prices will sharply decline on **Sunday**, when the expected average price will even turn negative at -0,8 cents. Sunday's prices will remain slightly below zero throughout the day. This is due to extremely strong winds, raising average wind power production to nearly 2800 MW.

On **Monday** and **Tuesday**, electricity prices will remain relatively low. Monday‚Äôs average price will be only 0,2 cents, and Tuesday‚Äôs average will also stay just above one cent. Nevertheless, there remains a risk of price spikes on individual hours for both days, although maximum prices will not reach the levels observed on Friday and Saturday.

Also, on next **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, prices will be relatively low and stable. Wednesday‚Äôs average price will be 1,5 cents, with Thursday slightly higher at 1,6 cents. On both days, maximum prices will remain moderate, peaking around 4‚Äì5 cents.

Overall, next week's electricity pricing will be dominated by large fluctuations during the weekend, from the expensive Saturday to the extremely affordable Sunday. The beginning of the week will continue with reasonably low prices, and the end of the week will remain stable without significant price fluctuations.
