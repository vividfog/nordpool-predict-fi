During the upcoming week, electricity prices on the spot market will vary somewhat between days. **Tuesday** stands out with the highest average price at 10.0 cents. The maximum price on this day could rise to as much as 26.5 cents, which is clearly the highest of the week. The peak price on Tuesday is likely to occur between morning and midday, when wind power production is at its lowest. This suggests that low wind power production significantly drives up the price.

**Thursday** is also noteworthy, as there is a high risk of price spikes during individual hours. This is particularly due to the low minimum wind power output, which could partly explain the higher price levels. The expected average price on Thursday is 7.5 cents, with a maximum price reaching 18.8 cents.

The most affordable days of the week appear to be **Monday** and **Saturday**, with expected average prices of 2.8 and 3.0 cents, respectively. On these days, wind power production is at a high level, which in turn keeps prices low. Additionally, Friday is expected to be affordable in terms of prices, with an average price of 3.6 cents.

On Wednesday and Sunday, prices will remain reasonable, with average prices of 4.3 and 3.5 cents. On these days, the risk of price spikes is low, and the electricity price will remain moderate throughout the day.
