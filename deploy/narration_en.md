The week will look mostly inexpensive: on most days the average price will stay below four cents. However, higher hourly levels will stand out **on Saturday** and **on Thursday**. Saturday’s average is 7,5 ¢ and the maximum is expected at 14,3 ¢. The day will be a public holiday, which usually dampens consumption, but wind will be weak (min 164 MW), which can lift late‑morning prices; a possible peak would fall around 10:00–12:00. On Thursday the average will be 5,8 ¢ and the maximum 16,9 ¢. Wind power minimum will drop below 1000 MW (899 MW), which will explain the prominence of individual hours in the early evening; the spike risk would focus on 17:00–19:00.

Other days will stay low: **on Sunday** and **on Tuesday** the average will be 1,3 ¢, **on Wednesday** 1,5 ¢, **on Friday** 2,4 ¢ and **on Monday** 4,6 ¢. Strong winds early in the week will push levels down. Early‑morning hours on Sunday and Wednesday will even turn negative, down to -0,5 ¢ on Sunday. The cheapest hours will therefore fall early in the week and overnight, while individual hours on Thursday and Saturday may briefly stand out as clearly more expensive.
