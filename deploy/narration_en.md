The upcoming week offers a variety of electricity price forecasts. **Thursday** stands out with its high average price of 16.2 cents per kilowatt-hour and a maximum price exceeding 30 cents. This is partly due to the low wind power production, which is at its lowest at 248 megawatts. **Friday's** average price drops significantly to 8.9 cents, but the risk of price spikes remains.

During the weekend, prices are considerably lower. **Saturday** and **Sunday** feature average prices below 4 cents, making them the cheapest days of the week. Wind power production is higher over the weekend, supporting the low price trend.

The start of the week, **Monday** and **Tuesday**, shows average prices around 7 cents. During these days, wind power production remains at a moderate level, and no significant price fluctuations are expected. **Wednesday** forecasts a slightly declining average price of 6.3 cents, but the day's price expectations vary widely with a minimum price of 1.3 cents and a maximum price nearly reaching 20 cents.

Wind power production varies significantly across the days, affecting price trends. Price peaks are expected to occur especially in the morning and evening hours, but exact times may vary.
