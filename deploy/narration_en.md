*Next week, electricity price expectations vary significantly between days, with particularly high prices on Friday, while the beginning and end of the week offer more moderate price levels supported by wind power production.*

Loviisa 2 nuclear power plant has been under maintenance since 17 August 2025 at 04:00, and it is expected to end on 6 September 2025 at 00:00. This maintenance may affect the accuracy of the forecast, as training data from maintenance periods is limited.

In the upcoming week, there are clear fluctuations in the electricity market. **Friday** is expected to have the highest average price, 26.2 ¢/kWh, partly due to low wind power production, averaging only 343 MW. The maximum price for the day could reach as high as 58.7 ¢, creating a significant contrast to other days. **Saturday** and **Sunday** hold a high risk of price spikes during certain hours. Saturday's average price is 13.9 ¢/kWh, while Sunday's average price drops to 6.8 ¢/kWh, which is markedly cheaper than on other days. On Sunday, wind power production rises significantly, partly explaining the price decrease.

**Monday** brings the week's lowest average price, 4.2 ¢/kWh, thanks to strong wind power production averaging 2732 MW. On **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, electricity prices remain moderate at 5.9 and 6.5 ¢/kWh, respectively, due to continued steady wind power production. On **Thursday**, the average price is 4.8 ¢/kWh, with wind power production remaining at a reasonable level.

As the week progresses, price fluctuations are quite pronounced, particularly with Friday's high prices standing out. However, electricity price expectations are more moderate at the beginning and end of the week, creating opportunities for more affordable electricity use.
