The start of the week will stand out with higher price levels. **Monday**’s expected average will be 10.8 ¢ with a range of 1.9–18.9 ¢. **Tuesday** will average 8.8 ¢ with a range of 1.8–19.9 ¢. A risk of single-hour spikes is noted for these days: Monday’s evening peak would fall around 17:00–19:00 and Tuesday’s morning peak around 08:00–10:00. On both days the minimum wind output will be exceptionally low (Monday 837 MW, Tuesday 905 MW), which explains the higher maximum prices.

Average prices will drop markedly from **Wednesday** onward. From Wednesday to Sunday, daily averages will stay between 1.8–2.8 ¢ and the maxima between 3.9–6.3 ¢, with abundant wind (over 3,000 MW on average). On **Friday** night there will even be a negative hour, around 01:00–03:00 (minimum −0.7 ¢), and on **Sunday** a similar dip will fall around 02:00–04:00 (−0.2 ¢). The cheapest day of the week will be Friday at a 1.8 ¢ average, while early-week prices will generally be higher.
