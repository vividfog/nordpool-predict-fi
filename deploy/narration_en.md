In the coming week, significant fluctuations in electricity price forecasts are expected across different days. **Saturday** stands out with its high prices, with an expected average price of 12.7 Â¢/kWh and a maximum price rising to 25.3 Â¢/kWh. This is partly due to low wind power production, which is at a minimum of only 258 MW. **Sunday**, on the other hand, offers more affordable prices, with an average price of 5.7 Â¢/kWh. There is also a greater variation in wind power on Sunday, which may contribute to the price decrease.

**Monday** offers the week's most affordable average price at 3.7 Â¢/kWh, and wind power production is strong, which partly explains the low prices. **Tuesday** sees a slight price increase, but it remains moderate with an average price of 5.8 Â¢/kWh. On Wednesday, an average price of 6.3 Â¢/kWh is expected, with a higher maximum price forecasted at 12.7 Â¢/kWh.

**Thursday** brings slightly declining prices, with an average price of 4.5 Â¢/kWh. The week concludes with **Friday**, where the average price rises again to 7.2 Â¢/kWh. On Friday, wind power production is relatively low, which may increase the price.
