*The electricity price forecast for the week shows significant fluctuations: low prices at the start of the week rise towards the weekend, with potential price spikes on Saturday and Sunday due to low wind power production.*

The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is undergoing maintenance. The maintenance started on 20th September 2025 at 01:00 and is expected to end on 10th October 2025 at 01:00. The Loviisa 1 nuclear power plant is also under maintenance, which began on 6th September 2025 at 10:00 and is forecasted to end on 29th September 2025 at 12:00. These maintenance outages may affect the accuracy of the forecast, as training data from maintenance periods is limited.

As the week begins on **Monday**, the electricity price is expected to be the lowest, at just 0.4 ¢/kWh. The high level of wind power contributes to this affordable price level. **Tuesday** sees a slight increase in the average price, remaining modest. On **Wednesday**, the price is anticipated to average at 4.1 ¢/kWh, slightly higher than earlier in the week, yet still reasonable.

**Thursday** and **Friday** maintain a reasonable price level, but a significant increase is observed on **Saturday** and **Sunday**. Saturday is expected to have the week's highest average price at 11.6 ¢/kWh, rising further to 13.0 ¢/kWh on Sunday. Both days forecast high hourly prices, possibly due to low wind power. There is a high risk of price spikes on Saturday and Sunday, particularly during morning and evening hours. Saturday's peak may occur between 8:00 and 10:00, while Sunday's peak might be between 19:00 and 21:00.

The week's price development is highly variable, starting with very low prices early in the week and culminating in higher prices over the weekend. This may result from fluctuations in wind power production and nuclear plant maintenance outages.
