The expected electricity prices for the coming week show significant variation between different days. **Monday** stands out as the most expensive day of the week, with an average price potentially rising to 11.9 cents and a maximum price possibly reaching 23.0 cents. This is due to low wind power production, which adds pressure to price increases. High price spikes may occur particularly during morning hours when demand grows.

**Tuesday** and **Wednesday** offer some relief, with average prices falling below 8 cents. This is due to improved wind power production, which supports price declines. Wednesday's average price, at 6.1 cents, is notably lower than the price expectations for the beginning of the week. However, the risk of price spikes remains, especially during morning and evening hours.

The cheapest prices of the week are expected on **Friday** and **Saturday**, with average prices dropping below 4 cents. This is partly because wind power production is generally higher on these days. Friday, in particular, sees significant variation in wind power production, but the risk of price spikes is low.

Over the weekend, particularly on **Saturday**, electricity prices remain low, offering consumers the opportunity to take advantage of cheaper rates. Wind power production is expected to be high on these days, helping to keep prices down.
