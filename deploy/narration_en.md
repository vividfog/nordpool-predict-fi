The spot electricity price will fluctuate significantly over the coming week. The most affordable days will occur during the weekend, whereas prices will rise notably at the beginning of the week. Particularly, **Saturday** will be very affordable, with an average price of 0.7 cents and the lowest hourly rate reaching as low as 0.1 cents. **Sunday** will also see low prices, with electricity prices even briefly dropping into the negative (-0.1 ¢) during nighttime.

At the start of the week, prices will turn clearly upwards. The week's highest average price, 5.4 ¢, will occur on **Wednesday**, when the highest hourly price of the week, 9 cents, is expected during the evening hours between 18:00–20:00. **Monday** and **Tuesday** will also be somewhat more expensive days, with average prices around 4.5–4.9 cents.

The week's highest individual hours typically appear during morning and evening peaks in consumption. For instance, on **Monday**, prices will rise above 8 cents between 8:00–10:00 in the morning, and on **Wednesday** evening between 18:00–20:00, reaching even 9 cents. These individual peak prices correlate with lower wind power production, which occasionally dips clearly below one thousand megawatts.

Towards the end of the week, electricity prices will remain higher than usual, but slightly lower compared to the beginning of the week. On **Thursday**, the average price will be 4.3 cents, and on **Friday**, slightly lower at around 3.9 cents. During these days, price fluctuations will not be as pronounced as earlier in the week, though some higher-priced individual hours will still occur.

For consumers, the weekend will offer good opportunities to plan heavier electricity usage during cheaper hours. In contrast, during the weekdays, it is advisable to consider that particularly morning and evening hours may bring higher prices.
