Prices are expected to stay low later in the week. Both **Thursday** and **Friday** will be public holidays, which will ease demand and push average prices below four cents. Thursday’s average will be 1.9 ¢ (0.2–3.4 ¢), and abundant wind output will underpin the low level. On **Saturday**, the pattern will return close to Thursday’s, with a 1.9 ¢ average and a 0.9–3.4 ¢ range.

The week’s higher-priced days will land early in the week: on **Tuesday** and **Wednesday** the average will be 6.0 ¢, and the day’s priciest hours will rise to 9.6–10.5 ¢. Tuesday’s highs will cluster around 09:00–11:00. On Wednesday the evening will stand out, around 18:00–20:00. In between sit **Sunday** and **Monday**, where averages will stay at 2.7 and 3.4 ¢ and the maximum will be 4.7–5.1 ¢. The week’s cheapest moments will likely fall in the early hours of Thursday, around 00:00–02:00, when prices dip to 0.2–0.6 ¢.
