Electricity prices will vary significantly in the coming days. **Friday** will be the week's most affordable day, with the average price expected to be near zero and even negative overnight and early morning. In fact, during the night towards Friday between 03:00–05:00, the price will dip as low as -1,4 cents, meaning electricity producers effectively pay consumers to use electricity.

The highest price levels of the week will occur early next week. **Monday** stands out clearly with the highest average price, expected at 4,5 cents per kilowatt-hour. The week's peak instantaneous price of exactly 10 cents is also expected Monday evening around 19:00–21:00.

Weekend price trends also bring variability. On **Saturday**, the electricity price will rise up to 9,1 cents in the evening hours between 19:00–21:00, resulting in a daily average of 2,7 cents. On **Sunday**, price fluctuations will also occur, though more moderately, with an average daily price of 1,8 cents and a peak of 5 cents around 20:00–22:00 in the evening.

Wind power generation will notably impact pricing. On Friday, abundant wind power averaging nearly 5000 megawatts largely explains the very low price level for that day. In contrast, wind generation on Saturday will be very limited, averaging only 957 megawatts, directly correlating to higher peak prices. Similarly, Monday's wind power output remains relatively low, averaging around 1110 megawatts, lifting that day's average price.

The risk of hourly price spikes has been noted for several days: Thursday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, and Wednesday may see individual hours exceeding forecasted price levels. On these days, it will be advisable to monitor price developments closely, especially during evening hours when price spikes typically occur.
