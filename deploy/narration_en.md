Next week's electricity market shows varying prices. **Tuesday** stands out in the forecast with a particularly low average price of just 1.1 ¬¢/kWh and even negative minimum prices. This is due to strong wind power production, expected to average 1746 MW. **Sunday**, on the other hand, might encounter price spikes, particularly in the late afternoon and evening, when the price could rise to 7.3 ¬¢/kWh. At this time, wind power production is forecasted to be at its lowest.

**Wednesday** and **Thursday** show a risk of price spikes, with significant fluctuations in wind power production during the day. On Wednesday, the predicted wind power production range is from 809 MW to 2583 MW, which might temporarily raise prices.

The week's most economical days include **Tuesday** and **Saturday**, with prices expected to remain moderate. The highest maximum prices of the week appear to be on **Sunday** and **Wednesday**, when low wind power production and high demand peaks might temporarily raise prices.

Overall, the forecasts indicate that while wind power production introduces variability in prices, the impact of temperature remains minimal. This is due to generally warm weather conditions, which do not create a significant increase in demand.
