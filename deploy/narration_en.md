From Thursday to Sunday, prices will stay clearly low. **Thursday’s** average price will be 1,0 ¢, **Friday’s** 0,4 ¢ and **Saturday’s** 1,9 ¢; **Sunday** will come in at 2,7 ¢. Negative hours will also appear on Friday, bottoming at -0,5 ¢ around 03:00–05:00. On Saturday prices will dip below zero again, down to -0,5 ¢ at 06:00–08:00, but in the afternoon and early evening they will briefly rise to 5,4 ¢. Abundant wind from Thursday to Sunday (daily averages ranging from 3 873 to 5 977 MW) will support the low price level.

From next **Monday** to **Wednesday** the level will rise: average prices will be 8,1–8,8–8,5 ¢. Weak wind (daily averages of 2 062–2 352 MW) will lift prices, and single-hour spikes will be anticipated. Monday’s peak will fall in the evening, around 17:00–19:00, at a maximum of 14,0 ¢. **Tuesday** will carry a high spike risk; the peak will fall around 09:00–11:00 and reach 15,1 ¢. Behind this will be a very low wind power minimum, down to 1 279 MW, which will explain the higher peak. **Wednesday** will be a public holiday, which may dampen demand, but in the evening (17:00–19:00) the peak will still climb to 13,1 ¢.
