| **Monday**    | 4.5 | 1.2 - 9.1 | 359 - 1558 | 17.7 |
| **Tuesday**      | 4.7 | 2.3 - 8.4 | 283 - 1336 | 18.6 |
| **Wednesday**  | 5.8 | 2.0 - 10.1 | 799 - 1562 | 19.3 |
| **Thursday**      | 4.9 | 3.1 - 7.6 | 663 - 1052 | 19.6 |
| **Friday**    | 5.7 | 3.2 - 10.1 | 681 - 1061 | 19.1 |
| **Saturday**     | 3.7 | 1.9 - 7.0 | 678 - 1777 | 19.2 |

In the upcoming week, electricity prices are expected to fluctuate. **Monday** particularly stands out, as the day's highest forecasted electricity price exceeds 9 cents, one of the highest for the week. This may be related to the low minimum wind power level of only 359 MW. Price spikes might occur during the morning and evening hours, especially between 8-10 AM and 5-7 PM. The average prices for **Tuesday** and **Wednesday** are slightly higher, and Wednesday is forecasted to reach a maximum price of 10.1 cents. This points to potentially higher costs midweek.

**Thursday** and **Friday** settle at levels close to the beginning of the week, but higher maximum prices are expected on Friday, indicating potential price spikes during the afternoon and evening. **Saturday** appears to be one of the cheapest days of the week in terms of prices, and wind power production is forecasted to be at its highest, which may help lower the price level.

Average temperatures remain above 15 ¬∞C throughout the week, which is not expected to influence electricity prices. Wind power production varies, but it rises notably on **Saturday**, which may partially explain the day's lower average price.
