The weekend and the start of next week will show clear variation. **On Saturday**, a 2,9–15,5 ¢ range and an average of 8,8 ¢ are expected. Wind generation is forecast to stay exceptionally low (min 456 MW), so individual peak hours may materialize higher than forecast; the peak is expected around 16:00–18:00. **On Sunday**, it is a public holiday, so the average price is expected to settle at 3,6 ¢. Short spikes are possibly expected around the middle of the day, roughly 11:00–13:00.

At the start of the week, the price level is expected to rise. **On Monday**, the average is expected at 10,3 ¢ and the day’s high at 18,6 ¢; the peak is expected around 17:00–19:00. **On Tuesday**, the week’s highest single price, 22,4 ¢, and an average of 12,0 ¢ are expected; the minimum wind output (1189 MW) is forecast to stay below 2000 MW, which explains the elevated peak. From Wednesday onward, prices are expected to ease: the averages for **Wednesday** and Thursday will stay below four cents, and **Friday’s** low will be around zero. Strong winds (over 3000 MW) are expected to support the low price level from Wednesday to Friday.
