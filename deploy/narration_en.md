The week will start on the expensive side: on **Tuesday** the average price will rise to 14,8 ¢, and the day’s high will land in the midday window 12:00–14:00 (25,2 ¢). Wind output will average only 1 981 MW then, and an exceptionally low minimum (1064 MW) will clearly explain the higher peak price. On **Wednesday** the average will ease to 12,1 ¢, but the forecast will include a spike risk for individual hours in the morning around 08:00–10:00; the day’s maximum is projected at 18,1 ¢. After that, the level will stabilize.

From **Thursday** onward, prices will ease. The average prices for **Friday**, **Saturday** and **Sunday** will settle at 4,1–3,2–4,4 ¢, and strong wind generation, mostly above 3 000 MW, will be reflected in lower prices. The week’s cheapest hours will fall in the early hours of Saturday, 02:00–04:00, when the price will touch 1,5 ¢. Next **Monday** will edge up slightly from the weekend: the average price is projected at 7,8 ¢ and the day’s upper bound at 11,9 ¢.
