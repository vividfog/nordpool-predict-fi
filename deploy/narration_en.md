*The electricity price forecast for next week suggests a fluctuating price level, with the early week standing out due to higher average prices. Wind power production and weather conditions significantly influence price variations, with the highest risk of price spikes on Monday and Tuesday.*

Loviisa 1 nuclear power plant is undergoing maintenance, starting from 6th September 2025 at 10:00 and is expected to end on 24th September 2025 at 00:00. Loviisa 2 plant has been under maintenance since 17th August 2025 at 04:00, and it is projected to continue until 9th September 2025 at 00:00. These maintenance outages may impact the accuracy of the electricity price forecast as there is limited training data available during such periods.

Next week's electricity price forecast is quite variable, but certain trends stand out clearly. **On Monday**, the highest average price of the week is expected, rising to 6.0 ¢/kWh. This is partly due to a low minimum wind power production forecasted at 471 MW, which may particularly increase maximum prices. **On Tuesday**, price expectations decrease slightly, with an average price of 5.0 ¢/kWh, but noteworthy are individual high maximum prices that can exceed 10 ¢. **On Sunday** and **Wednesday**, prices remain moderate, with average prices around 2.2–2.3 ¢/kWh.

Towards the end of the week, **Thursday** and **Friday**, the price level is predicted to be very affordable, with average prices at 0.8 ¢/kWh and 0.6 ¢/kWh. This is partly influenced by stronger wind power, which is forecasted to average over 2500 MW. **Saturday** continues this trend with an even slightly lower average price, dropping to 0.5 ¢/kWh.

During the week, the risk of price spikes is most significant **on Monday** and **Tuesday**, when during the peak morning and evening hours, higher prices may occur. This is particularly emphasized on Monday between 08:00–10:00 and 18:00–20:00, when maximum prices might rise. Otherwise, the week appears relatively stable for more affordable prices.
