The week’s price trend would look split in two. **Wednesday** would average 0,7 ¢, with negative hours at night, down to -0,7 ¢. **Saturday** would likewise remain low (avg 1,7 ¢). On both days, wind power would be plentiful, supporting low price expectations. **Thursday’s** average would be 4,6 ¢. **Friday** and **Monday** would settle around five to six cents. **Sunday** is a public holiday, which could depress demand and prices; avg 4,0 ¢. The clearly most expensive day will be **Tuesday**, with the average rising to 12,6 ¢ and the top hourly price to 21,6 ¢; at the same time, wind power minimum would drop exceptionally low (737 MW).

Spike risk will appear only on the specifically mentioned days. On **Friday**, peaks would fall in the morning between 8–10, when the forecast reaches 15,2 ¢. On **Sunday**, the morning 9–11 would stand out, up to 10,0 ¢. On **Tuesday**, peak hours would cluster in the morning 8–10 (up to 21,6 ¢) and in the evening 17–19 (about 20,5 ¢). Tuesday’s elevated maximum would be explained by an especially low wind power minimum, remaining clearly below 2,000 MW.
