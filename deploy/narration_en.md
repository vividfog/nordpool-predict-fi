The start of the week is expected to be clearly more expensive than the latter part. The most notable day will be **Tuesday**, with an average price of 7,7 ¢ and a peak at 10,6 ¢. The forecast flags a risk of single-hour spikes then, most likely in the morning around 08:00–10:00. On **Monday**, the daily maximum would climb to 12,1 ¢. This is explained by an exceptionally low minimum wind output (749 MW), clearly below 2,000 MW. Monday’s peak would land in the early evening, roughly 16:00–18:00.

From Wednesday to Friday public holidays will likely weigh on demand. The clearest drop will appear on **Thursday** and **Friday**, with average prices of 4,6 ¢ and 3,2 ¢. Later in the week the wind strengthens markedly, supporting a cheap level: on **Saturday** the average would be 2,2 ¢ and on **Sunday** 3,1 ¢. The week’s lowest hours will be in the early hours of Friday around 03:00–05:00, bottoming at 0,7 ¢. Over the weekend, hourly prices will be largely below four cents.
