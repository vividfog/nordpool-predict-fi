The start of the week will stand out clearly from the rest. On **Tuesday**, the average price will rise to 16.3 cents and intraday volatility will be large. The peak hourly price, 27.6 Â¢, would occur in the late morning around 09:00â€“11:00, and another distinctly expensive period would appear in the evening around 19:00â€“21:00. The dayâ€™s minimum wind power stays at 480 MW, and this low minimum explains why the dayâ€™s maximum price rises to the weekâ€™s highest. A clear risk of singleâ€‘hour price spikes is also indicated for Tuesday, so the peaks could materialize higher than projected.

**On Wednesday**, the price would stabilize but remain clearly above Tuesdayâ€™s level: the daily average is 10.8 Â¢ and the top hour 23.0 Â¢. The expensive morning window would fall around 08:00â€“10:00. This day is also marked with elevated spike risk. Wind power is on average weak, which supports a somewhat higher level compared with the late week.

The latter part of the week will look entirely different. **On Thursday**, an exceptionally large amount of wind power will be available, pushing prices very low: the average is 1.3 Â¢ and the lowest hour dips negative at night, around 03:00â€“05:00 (âˆ’0.1 Â¢). **Fridayâ€™s** and the weekendâ€™s price levels will remain inexpensive. On Friday the average is 3.9 Â¢, on **Saturday** 5.9 Â¢ and on **Sunday** 3.2 Â¢. Winds on these days are mostly strong or at least moderate, reflected in a flat, low price profile without large swings.

Next **Monday**, the price will remain moderate, avg 4.6 Â¢. The dayâ€™s highest level, 8.8 Â¢, would fall in the evening around 20:00â€“22:00, but the overall picture will resemble the weekend. The weekâ€™s cheapest hours will likely occur in the early hours of Thursday, whereas the clearly most expensive periods will concentrate on Tuesdayâ€™s late morning and evening.
