| **Friday** | 7,4 | 1,9 - 14,7 | 763 - 2255 | 6,6 |
| **Saturday** | 9,7 | 2,9 - 17,1 | 338 - 1019 | 6,4 |
| **Sunday** | 3,4 | 1,2 - 6,7 | 1055 - 3260 | 5,4 |

The week’s highest average price will likely fall on **Tuesday**, 11,0 ¢, and the day’s peak would also be high at 19,0 ¢. This is explained by low minimum wind production (1191 MW) on Tuesday. **Saturday** also stands out: wind power would be exceptionally low (avg 631 MW, min 338 MW), which would show up as a higher maximum of 17,1 ¢. Saturday is forecast to carry spike risk especially in the evening at 17:00–19:00. On **Monday**, a spike may occur in the evening at 18:00–20:00 (daily max 16,3 ¢), and elevated levels are expected in the morning.

**Sunday** is a public holiday, which may reduce demand and prices; the average would remain at 3,4 ¢ and any upticks would be limited to midday at 11:00–13:00. The week’s cheapest hours would likely cluster on Sunday late evening and night (1,2–2,5 ¢) and in the small hours of Friday (about 1,9–2,0 ¢). Midweek, **Wednesday** and **Thursday** look more even, with most of the range around 4–9 ¢.
