The electricity prices for the upcoming week show variability between different days. **On Sunday**, prices are expected to fluctuate widely, ranging from a minimum of -0.2 ¢ to a maximum of 8.2 ¢. This is partly due to low wind power production, with a minimum of only 675 MW. **Monday**, on the other hand, appears to be calmer, with prices expected to remain between 0.4 - 5.6 ¢, and wind power production potentially rising to 3490 MW.

**Tuesday** and **Wednesday** are forecasted to have moderately low average prices of 1.7 ¢ and 1.1 ¢, respectively, partly due to moderate wind power production. **Thursday** stands out with the most favorable average price of 0.4 ¢, with the minimum price potentially dropping to -0.9 ¢. This is due to high wind power production, ranging from 1598 MW to 2745 MW.

**On Friday**, prices may vary widely, from a minimum of -0.1 ¢ to a maximum of 5.8 ¢, which can be explained by the low minimum wind power production of only 855 MW. **Saturday** prices are more moderate, with an average of 1.7 ¢, but there is a risk of price spikes.
