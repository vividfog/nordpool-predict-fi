Prices are expected to fluctuate over the week. **Wednesday** is projected to dip to an average of 3,0 ¢, and **Sunday** will also stay near four cents. **Tuesday** is expected at 5,5 ¢ and **Thursday** at 6,2 ¢. The priciest day will be next **Monday**, when the average is forecast to reach 10,7 ¢; on **Friday** the average settles at 9,4 ¢. Strong wind mid‑week will push prices down, whereas weak average wind on Friday and Monday will lift the level.

The risk of price spikes is expected to stand out on **Friday** and next **Monday**. Friday’s peak would fall between 16:00–18:00, taking prices above 15 ¢. On Monday, spikes concentrate in the morning 08:00–10:00 and again in the afternoon 15:00–17:00, with levels possibly rising above 16 ¢. On both days, minimum wind output stays below 2,000 MW, which explains the higher peaks. **Saturday** is a public holiday, so demand may ease and the average hold at 5,0 ¢, though a single uptick may hit the morning 08:00–10:00. The cheapest hours look to cluster from Tuesday evening into the early hours of Wednesday (around 20:00–02:00), when prices touch the 0,3–1,0 ¢ range.
