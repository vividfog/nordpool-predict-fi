In the upcoming week, electricity price expectations show fluctuations, but overall the price level remains moderate. On **Thursday** and **Friday**, price expectations are higher compared to the weekend days. **Friday's** average price is 4.1 cents, and the most expensive time of the day may rise to 8.4 cents. This can be explained by low wind power production, averaging 836 megawatts.

On **Saturday** and **Sunday**, prices are expected to drop significantly, with average prices below two cents. On **Sunday**, a negative minimum price of -0.2 cents is even observed, which is rare. Wind power production increases over the weekend, which partly explains the lower prices.

On **Monday** and **Tuesday**, prices rise slightly from the weekend but remain at a reasonable level, around three cents. On **Wednesday**, the price rises slightly higher to 3.5 cents but remains relatively stable without significant price spikes.

Overall, the coming week offers varying electricity price expectations, influenced particularly by wind power production. Although price spikes occur in individual hours, prices remain reasonable on the whole.
