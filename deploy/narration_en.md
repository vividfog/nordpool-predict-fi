In the upcoming week, electricity prices in the market will vary significantly. **Tuesday** is expected to have the highest average price of the week, at 6.4 cents/kWh, and prices could rise up to 14.6 cents. This is likely due to the relatively low minimum wind power production, only 515 MW. The risk of price spikes is present, especially in the evening between 7 PM and 9 PM.

**Wednesday** sees a slight decrease in the average price to 6.0 cents, but the maximum price could still reach 12.9 cents. Wind power production varies significantly throughout the day, potentially causing price spikes, particularly in the morning between 9 AM and 11 AM. **Thursday** sees the average price drop further to 5.5 cents, with higher wind power production, which may help mitigate price spikes.

The cheapest days of the week appear to be **Saturday**, **Sunday**, and the following **Monday**, with average prices remaining below two cents. On these days, there is an abundance of wind power available, explaining the low prices. Particularly on **Sunday**, the minimum price could even be negative. The weekend thus offers favorable prices for consumers.
