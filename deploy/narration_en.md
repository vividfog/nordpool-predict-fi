Prices will stay mostly moderate, but a clear exception will be seen on Tuesday. **On Saturday**, it will be a public holiday, and the average price is expected to settle at 5,7 ¢ (2,7–8,0 ¢). **Sunday’s** average will dip to 4,7 ¢, aided by strong wind. **On Monday**, the average will rise to 8,0 ¢; behind it is a low wind power level (avg. 2512 MW). **Tuesday** will stand out as the most expensive day of the week: average 9,9 ¢ and a forecast maximum of 18,8 ¢. Later in the week, prices will even out: **on Wednesday** 5,6 ¢, **on Thursday** 6,3 ¢ and **on Friday** 5,7 ¢, with higher wind supporting the more moderate level.

Spike risk will be elevated on **Tuesday**. The most expensive hours look likely around 10:00–12:00. The rise is explained by a very low wind power minimum, only 738 MW, while the day’s peak price is clearly higher than on other days. **On Saturday** there will also be isolated spikes, most likely around midnight, 23:00–01:00. On other days, intraday variation will remain moderate, and the cheapest moments will fall at night and in the early morning, when prices drop on several days below four cents.
