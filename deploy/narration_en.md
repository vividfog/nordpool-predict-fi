Electricity prices on the stock market will vary significantly throughout the upcoming week. **On Sunday**, prices will remain very low, with an average price of only 0.4 ¢/kWh, and there will be plenty of wind power available, which partly explains the low price level. **On Monday**, however, the price forecast rises to an average of 2.4 ¢/kWh, with price spikes expected during individual hours, especially during peak morning and evening hours.

**On Tuesday**, prices are expected to be low again, with an average price of 0.8 ¢/kWh. This may be due to abundant wind power production, which stabilizes prices at a low level. **On Wednesday**, the price level rises slightly, and there is a risk of price spikes, which may temporarily increase prices.

On Thursday, the price forecast rises to an average of 4.1 ¢/kWh, which is significantly higher than earlier in the week. Electricity prices may rise particularly in the morning and evening when there is less wind power available. **Friday** stands out with its highest average price of 5.2 ¢/kWh, and the maximum price rises to even 10 ¢, which may be due to low wind power production.

Over the weekend, **on Saturday**, prices decrease again to an average of 2.4 ¢/kWh, but the risk of price spikes remains during individual hours. Variations in wind power production may continue to influence price fluctuations throughout the week.
