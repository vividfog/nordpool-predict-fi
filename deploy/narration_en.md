| **Tuesday** | 6.3 | 3.4 - 13.1 | 1487 - 4412 | 3.6 |

Clear variation will be expected through the week. On **Thursday**, the daily average will settle around 1,8 ¢ and some negative night hours will appear. Averages for **Friday**, **Saturday** and **Monday** will climb above 10 ¢ (10,7; 11,1; 11,7 ¢). On **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, the level will remain moderate at roughly 6,3–6,8 ¢, and on **Sunday** the average will dip to 4,8 ¢.

Spike risk will be clearly elevated on **Friday** in particular. The day’s high, 22,3 ¢, is expected around 10:00–12:00. Exceptionally low minimum wind output (618 MW) explains why Friday’s peak becomes the week’s highest. Intraday dispersion will be large, as the low will be 2,2 ¢.

The high spike risk will likely persist on **Saturday**. The peak, 16,6 ¢, appears to land in the morning window 08:00–10:00. Average wind generation will stay weak (1722 MW), and the minimum will be 773 MW, which supports elevated hourly prices, especially during the busy morning hours.

On **Monday**, spikes will also be anticipated on individual hours. The week’s highest daily average, 11,7 ¢, pairs with a maximum of 18,8 ¢, expected around 15:00–17:00. Minimum wind output (911 MW) will remain well below 2000 MW, which lifts the day’s late-afternoon peaks.

On **Sunday**, prices will stay even within 3,3–6,3 ¢. Thursday’s low, occasionally negative prices will be linked to a windy spell (average 5094 MW), and the same tendency will show in Sunday’s stronger supply (3621 MW). On **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, prices will remain reasonable without notable extremes: daily peaks will cap at 13,1 ¢ and 11,2 ¢.
