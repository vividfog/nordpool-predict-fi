During the upcoming week, electricity prices will fluctuate considerably between days and hours. The highest prices will appear early in the week, whereas the weekend will clearly offer lower rates.

The week's highest hourly prices are expected on **Wednesday**, when the price could soar above 15 cents during the morning hours between 8:00–10:00. Wednesday's daily average price will be 6.1 ¢, the highest of the week. The risk of individual price spikes will be notably elevated on Wednesday, especially in the morning.

Relatively high hourly prices will also occur late **Monday** evening between 21:00–23:00, with prices forecasted above 11 cents. Monday's average price will settle at 5.8 cents.

On **Thursday** and **Friday**, prices will be more moderate, although individual hourly price spikes may still occur. Thursday's highest price, 7.4 ¢, will appear around 20:00 in the evening, while Friday's peak, 8.6 ¢, is expected between 8:00–10:00 in the morning. However, the daily averages for these days will remain below five cents.

The weekend will clearly be the cheapest period of the week. On **Saturday**, the average price drops below one cent (0.9 ¢), with the day's highest hourly price reaching just 1.7 cents at 8:00. On **Sunday**, there will even be a negative price period at night between 1:00–3:00 (-0.6 ¢), and the daily average will remain very low at around 1.5 cents. Prices will slightly rise again Sunday evening between 20:00–22:00, peaking slightly above five cents. The risk of individual hourly price spikes also exists on Sunday.

Thus, the weekly price fluctuations will be quite pronounced, and price-conscious electricity users will find particularly favorable periods during the weekend.
