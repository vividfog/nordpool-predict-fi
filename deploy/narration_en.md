Next week, electricity prices are expected to vary moderately, with no major deviations anticipated. **Tuesday** is forecasted to have the lowest average prices, partly due to strong wind power production reaching up to 3055 MW. Prices may even dip into negative territory during certain hours, particularly in the early morning.

**Monday** and **Wednesday** may see price spikes during individual hours. Monday's highest expected price is 6.9 ¬¢, while on Wednesday, the price could rise to 6.1 ¬¢. These may occur during morning or evening hours when electricity consumption typically increases.

The forecast indicates that **Saturday** will be the most affordable day, with the average price remaining at 2.3 ¬¢. Wind power production will be at a reasonable level, supporting expectations for lower prices. **Friday** might see a slight increase in prices but will still stay below 5 ¬¢.
