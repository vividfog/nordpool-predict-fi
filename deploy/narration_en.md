During the upcoming week, electricity prices will mostly remain moderate. **On Wednesday**, prices are expected to fluctuate slightly, with the minimum price dropping even into the negative. This suggests that there might be short-term electricity production surpluses during the night. However, on **Wednesday evening**, price spikes could raise the maximum price above eight cents. Wind power production is low at that time, explaining the higher maximum price.

**On Thursday**, the average electricity price will rise slightly from the previous day, and the maximum price will remain high during the evening. **Friday's** price expectations are more moderate, with the average price being below three cents. Wind power production is on average at a higher level, helping to keep prices lower.

**On Saturday** and **Sunday**, prices will remain relatively low, with Sunday's average price being one of the lowest of the week. This is partly due to wind power production being slightly higher on Sunday. **On Monday**, the average electricity price will rise again but will still remain below four cents.

The week concludes **on Tuesday**, when the price level will rise slightly again, with an average price of 3.7 cents. Overall, there are no significant deviations in the week's price trend, but individual price spikes might occasionally raise evening prices.
