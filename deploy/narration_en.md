**On Friday**, the electricity price forecast shows higher values compared to other days of the week. The average price is 13.5 Â¢/kWh, with the most expensive hour of the day occurring in the evening when the price could rise to as much as 37.6 cents. This significantly differs from other days, where prices are considerably lower. Wind power production is relatively low on Friday, which might contribute to the higher prices.

**On Saturday** and **Sunday**, lower average prices of 3.7 Â¢ and 3.4 Â¢/kWh are forecasted. However, Saturday has a mention of a risk of price spikes, particularly during morning and evening hours, when prices could temporarily increase. Wind power production over the weekend is abundant, helping to keep average prices low.

**On Monday**, the price level remains moderate, with an average price of 3.1 Â¢/kWh. Wind power production is at a high level, which partly explains the low price level. **On Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, prices remain affordable, although on Wednesday, the average price rises slightly to 4.3 Â¢/kWh.

Later in the week, **on Thursday**, electricity prices drop again to a low level of 2.6 Â¢/kWh. The entire week is expected to have a fairly variable price level but generally remains affordable. Only the high forecasts on Friday stand out, making the weekend and early week the most cost-effective times for electricity usage.
