During the upcoming week, electricity prices will vary considerably, with forecasts showing significant differences between the days. **On Saturday** and **Sunday**, prices are expected to be affordable, with average prices staying below four cents. However, there is a risk of price spikes, particularly in the evening when wind power production is at its lowest.

**Monday** and **Tuesday** are anticipated to see a slight increase in price levels, with average prices exceeding four cents. On Tuesday, the maximum price could rise to 7.8 cents, potentially surprising consumers.

The forecast for Wednesday shows the highest price level of the week, with an average price of 5.5 cents. This is mainly due to high hourly prices in the afternoon when wind power production is predicted to be minimal.

**Thursday** and **Friday** will maintain relatively high price levels, with average prices slightly above five cents. On Friday, afternoon and evening hours could see prices exceeding nine cents, making it the most expensive moment of the week.

Overall, fluctuations in wind power production and potential price spikes are particularly emphasized in the evenings. This may require consumers to monitor the electricity price development more closely during the upcoming week.
