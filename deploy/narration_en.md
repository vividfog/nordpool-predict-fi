|:-------------|:----------------:|:----------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| **Monday** | 6,6 | 2,0 - 9,9 | 2180 - 4457 | 1,5 |
| **Tuesday** | 5,0 | 2,0 - 9,9 | 1110 - 6784 | 2,2 |
| **Wednesday** | 3,6 | 1,3 - 4,9 | 3342 - 7155 | 3,0 |
| **Thursday** | 7,9 | 4,0 - 11,6 | 1651 - 2875 | 3,0 |
| **Friday** | 10,2 | 3,3 - 18,9 | 959 - 2556 | 2,9 |
| **Saturday** | 6,3 | 2,9 - 12,0 | 1192 - 2900 | 1,8 |

The weekly price profile will lean toward moderate levels early in the week and pricier hours toward the end. The lowest average price will fall on **Wednesday**, 3,6 ¢. On **Sunday**, it would also stay at 4,6 ¢. **Friday** will become the most expensive at 10,2 ¢, as wind power is weak (avg 1 560 MW) and the minimum output drops to 959 MW; this also explains the week’s highest maximum, 18,9 ¢. On **Thursday** (avg 7,9 ¢), wind is generally at a low level, keeping price pressure elevated. **Saturday** is a public holiday; the average price would settle at 6,3 ¢.

The risk of price spikes will be pronounced on Thursday, Friday and Saturday. On **Thursday**, higher hourly prices would most likely appear between 08:00–10:00 (peak 11,6 ¢), driven by a low wind-power minimum of 1 651 MW. On **Friday**, spikes could occur between 16:00–18:00 (peak 18,9 ¢); the unusual level is associated with a very low wind-generation minimum of 959 MW. On **Saturday**, the highlighted window would be 08:00–10:00 (peak 12,0 ¢), and the wind minimum, 1 192 MW, also supports higher prices at those times.
