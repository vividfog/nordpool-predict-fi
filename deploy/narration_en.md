In the coming week, the electricity market is expected to see varying prices, driven particularly by fluctuations in wind power production. **Monday** appears to start the week with a relatively average price, but Tuesday is forecasted to see an increase in price levels. Tuesday's maximum price rises to 7.8 cents, which may elevate the average price. Notably, Tuesday's low wind power production may explain the higher prices.

**Wednesday** and **Thursday** are likely to maintain moderate price levels, although the risk of price spikes is indicated as possible. On Thursday, wind power production increases slightly, which might help stabilize the price. **Friday's** price expectations are somewhat lower, but the risk of price spikes remains, especially during morning and evening hours.

Over the weekend, prices drop significantly. **Saturday** and **Sunday** are the cheapest days of the week, with relatively high wind power production. Sunday, in particular, is forecasted to have very low prices, even negative, making it the most affordable day of the week.
