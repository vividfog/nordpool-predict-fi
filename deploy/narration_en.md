The week’s price trajectory will split clearly in two. **Tuesday** will be the most expensive day of the week: an average price of 14,8 ¢ and a daily peak of 25,2 ¢. The high level is linked to a very low minimum in wind generation (1089 MW), while the daily average stays at 2000 MW. The highest prices will fall in the morning, around 08:00–10:00. For the rest of the week, price swings will be smaller. From Thursday onward, wind output will be abundant, often above 3000 MW, pushing prices lower.

On **Wednesday**, a risk of price spikes is anticipated for individual hours; the most pronounced period is estimated around 08:00–10:00. The day’s average price will be 12,3 ¢ with a peak of 18,0 ¢. On Thursday the level will drop clearly (avg 7,4 ¢) and stay low through Friday and the weekend: Saturday’s average at 3,6 ¢, Sunday’s 4,0 ¢ and Friday’s 4,2 ¢. Daytime hours on Friday and the weekend will mostly sit at 3–5 ¢, nights clearly below four; at the lowest, in the early hours of Saturday, about 1,7–2,0 ¢. Toward Tuesday evening, prices will settle quickly. Next Monday the average will rise moderately to 6,1 ¢ and the range will sit around 3,1–9,2 ¢.
