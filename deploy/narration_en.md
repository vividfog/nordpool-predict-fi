The week is expected to be mostly inexpensive: most days average around 0.6–1.3 ¢, and Monday 3.8 ¢. A clear outlier will be on **Thursday**, with an average of 5.5 ¢ and the highest hourly price reaching 15.4 ¢. Thursday has a flagged risk for individual peak hours; the evening peak is projected around 17:00–19:00. At the same time, minimum wind output is expected to fall well below 2,000 MW (about 1,270 MW), which explains the higher evening price level.

The rest of the week will remain low, and at night prices will occasionally turn negative. The lowest hours are anticipated overnight into Saturday, around -0.5 ¢. **Monday** morning prices are projected to exceed six cents around 08:00–10:00. The week’s cheapest overall days will be **Saturday** (avg 0.6 ¢) and **Friday** (0.8 ¢). Strong winds for most of the week support the low price level, whereas **Thursday’s** deviation stems from a deep lull in wind output right at the evening peak.
