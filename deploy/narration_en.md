Early in the week, abundant wind power will press prices down.

A clear shift will be seen on **Thursday**, with an average of 6.6 ¢ and a daily high of 12.6 ¢. Single-hour spikes are expected on Thursday morning around 07:00–09:00. **Friday** will be the most expensive day of the week: an average of 10.3 ¢ and a maximum of 18.2 ¢. The peak risk will focus on Friday evening, roughly 17:00–19:00. The higher peaks on Thursday and Friday will be explained by very low minimum wind output, 1423 MW on Thursday and 815 MW on Friday. The cheapest stretches of the week will fall in the early night and morning of Saturday, when prices will mostly stay in the 0–0.4 ¢ range.
