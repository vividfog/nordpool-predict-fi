The week’s price trend will stand out with contrasting moves early on. **On Monday**, the expected level will be low, with night and early-morning hours hovering near zero (0,1–0,5 ¢). **On Tuesday**, the daily average will rise to 16,7 ¢ and the projected maximum will reach 30,4 ¢, making it clearly the most expensive day of the week. Later in the week the level will return to more moderate, and **on Sunday** the price range will stay within 1,8–4,1 ¢.

Abundant wind output will underpin the lower prices on several days. **On Monday**, **Thursday**, **Friday** and **Sunday**, average wind power will exceed 3000 MW, which typically pushes prices down. This will also be reflected in **Thursday’s** low average of 2,3 ¢ and narrow range of 1,5–4,1 ¢. The cheapest hours of the week will fall during Monday night, while Sunday will likely stay evenly low throughout the day.

**On Tuesday**, the risk of price spikes will be elevated on individual hours. The day’s minimum wind production will drop well below 2000 MW (538 MW), which helps explain the much higher 30,4 ¢ maximum. The top is most likely in the evening at 19–21, with another pronounced rise in the late morning at 9–11. Individual hours could climb above the projected maximum.

**On Wednesday**, the risk of elevated prices will appear in the morning hours. The day’s high, 21,4 ¢, will land in the morning, with the most critical window at 8–10. As the day progresses, the pressure will ease and prices will fall clearly lower in the evening, many hours already below 5 ¢ at 20–22.

**On Saturday**, isolated spikes will be anticipated especially in the early evening at 18–20, when the day’s high of 14,2 ¢ is projected. Around midday, prices will remain well below Tuesday’s, but weak wind will lift the level clearly above the week’s cheapest days.
