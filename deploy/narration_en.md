*Next week, variations in the spot electricity price are expected as wind power production levels are low, especially over the weekend, significantly raising prices. Tuesday will be the most affordable day of the week, while Saturday is expected to see high prices.*

In the coming week, significant fluctuations are expected in the spot electricity price. **Tuesday** is the most affordable day of the week, with an average price of about 1.4 cents and the lowest price possibly dropping to a negative -1.6 cents. This is due to the large amount of wind power, averaging 4576 MW. **Wednesday** offers slightly more expensive electricity, yet still at a moderate average price of 4.7 cents, with prices expected to stay below 10 cents.

**Friday's** average price rises to 6.3 cents, with the possibility of price spikes during individual hours, especially in the morning and evening, as wind power production is on average at a lower level. **Saturday**, on the other hand, stands out as the most expensive day of the week, with an average price climbing to 15.8 cents, and the highest price potentially reaching up to 31.6 cents. This is explained by extremely low wind power production, which significantly raises electricity prices.

**Sunday** sees prices stabilizing slightly, with an average of 10 cents, but individual price spikes remain possible. **Monday** offers more moderate pricing again, at 6.2 ¬¢, but there is also a risk of price spikes.
