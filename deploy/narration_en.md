In the coming week, electricity prices are expected to vary. **Thursday** stands out with a higher average price of 4.3 cents per kilowatt-hour. The most expensive hour of the day might occur in the late evening, with prices reaching up to 9.8 cents. This could be due to occasionally weak wind power production, ranging from 104-1135 MW.

**Saturday** and **Sunday** offer the cheapest average prices of the week, at 1.8 and 1.5 cents, with prices remaining mostly moderate. On Saturday, prices may temporarily rise in the evening, but overall, the days are stable. During the weekend, wind power production is quite strong, which partially explains the lower prices.

Next **Monday** sees prices rise again, with an average price of 4.6 cents. Wind power production is lower, and the maximum price could reach 8.7 cents. This may increase price peaks, especially during morning and evening hours.

Towards the end of the week on **Wednesday**, an increase in wind power production is expected, which lowers the average price to 2.1 cents. Production is variable, and the maximum price might rise to 6.2 cents. This could cause price spikes, particularly in the evening.
