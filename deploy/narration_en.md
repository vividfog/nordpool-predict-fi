The electricity price trend for the upcoming week appears variable, especially at the beginning of the week. **Monday** is relatively affordable, but higher prices are expected in the evening, peaking at 15.1 cents at 7 PM. **Tuesday** sees higher expected prices, and the risk of price spikes is significant. Prices could rise to 18.6 cents on Tuesday evening.

**Wednesday** forecasts even higher electricity price expectations, with the average price predicted at 10.6 cents. This is partly due to low wind power production, dropping to a minimum of 1036 megawatts. The risk of price spikes is also present on Wednesday. **Thursday** sees a slight decrease in prices, though they remain at a higher level.

**Friday** brings lower prices, with an abundance of wind power expected, explaining the affordable prices. The weekend days, **Saturday** and **Sunday**, appear to be the most affordable. On Saturday, prices may even turn negative during the night, and Sunday is expected to maintain low prices.

Thus, the week concludes with a significantly more affordable price level than it begins. Compared to the start of the week, the weekend offers consumers noticeably cheaper electricity prices.
