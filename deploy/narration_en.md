In the weekly overview, prices will mostly sit below four cents. One exception will be **Monday**, when the average is set to rise to 8,2 ¢ and the day’s top reaches 14,6 ¢. The cheapest days look to be **Sunday** (avg 0,7 ¢) and **Saturday** (avg 1,4 ¢).

**On Sunday**, prices should remain even. The lowest hours will likely fall overnight and early morning, while the evening around 18:00–20:00 should bring the day’s highest stretch (2,1–2,7 ¢). **On Monday**, single-hour peaks will likely cluster in the morning and early evening: the most likely top window is 9:00–11:00, with another elevated stretch around 17:00–19:00.

Midweek will edge back down. **On Tuesday**, the average is projected around 4,2 ¢, with late-morning hours briefly higher (up to 9,6 ¢). **On Wednesday**, variation should remain limited and a near‑zero minimum is possible, but most hours should stay within the 0–3 ¢ range.

The end of the week will remain moderate. **On Thursday** and **Friday** the averages will settle at 3,9 and 2,9 ¢, and no large intraday swings are anticipated. **On Saturday**, prices should again be low, with the day’s range confined to roughly 0,3–2,5 ¢.

Wind output will be plentiful on most days, supporting low prices. In particular, early‑ and late‑week days will average clearly above 3000 MW. **On Monday**, the minimum wind output drops to 1715 MW, and that same day records the week’s highest maximum price. The low minimum production will likely explain Monday’s markedly steeper hourly prices versus the rest of the week.
