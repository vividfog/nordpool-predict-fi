The coming week shows variability in electricity prices. **Sunday** offers the lowest prices of the week, with an average price of just 0.8 ¢/kWh, likely due to abundant wind power ranging from 2606 MW to 4682 MW throughout the day. This helps keep the price level low.

**Monday** predicts higher price expectations, with an average price rising to 6.0 ¢/kWh. This is due to decreased wind power production, which drops to a minimum of 368 MW. There is a risk of price spikes, especially during morning and evening hours, with a notable increase expected between 8-10 AM.

**Tuesday** offers a cheaper alternative with an average price of 1.9 ¢/kWh. Wind power production remains at a reasonable level, helping to keep prices moderate. The week's average temperatures start to decline, but this doesn't yet significantly impact electricity prices.

On Wednesday, prices rise slightly but remain reasonable, with an average price of 2.8 ¢/kWh. Wind power production fluctuates during the day but doesn't reach significantly low levels. This helps maintain stable prices without major spikes.

**Thursday** and **Friday** see slightly higher price levels again, with average prices at 5.0 and 6.2 ¢/kWh. Price spikes are particularly expected on Friday when wind power production is at its lowest. This could raise prices, especially during morning and evening peak hours.

The week ends with **Saturday's** moderate prices, with an average price of 4.3 ¢/kWh. Although there is a risk of price spikes, wind power production remains reasonable, helping to curb price increases.
