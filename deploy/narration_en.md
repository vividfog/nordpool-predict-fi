Electricity prices are expected to remain moderate over the coming week. Daily average prices will range from just above one cent to around five cents per kilowatt-hour. However, noticeable variation will occur between individual days.

The week's cheapest day will be **Tuesday**, with an average price of only 1.3 cents. At certain times during the early morning hours (3:00â€“5:00), prices will even drop below zero, reaching as low as -0.5 cents. Increased wind power production on Tuesday partly explains this low price level.

On **Sunday**, prices will also briefly dip into negative territory during the afternoon (13:00â€“15:00), with a lowest price of -0.4 cents. Sunday's average price will remain modest at around two cents. However, Sunday might experience isolated price spikes, when the price could momentarily rise significantly above the daily average.

The highest hourly prices of the week will occur on **Saturday**, when electricity prices will peak at nearly 13 cents in the evening hours (19:00â€“21:00). On the same day, the minimum wind power production is only 198 megawatts, contributing to the evening's higher prices.

Towards the end of the week, on **Friday**, prices will again rise slightly, with an average daily price among the week's highest, at 5.1 cents. Friday morning hours (7:00â€“9:00) are expected to be among the most expensive of the week, exceeding 11 cents.

Overall, the upcoming week will offer electricity consumers both extremely affordable moments and occasional higher-priced hours. Price fluctuations will be particularly noticeable in the mornings and evenings, when electricity demand typically increases.
