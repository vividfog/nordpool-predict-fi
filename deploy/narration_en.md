In the coming week, electricity prices will see some fluctuation. **Thursday** and **Friday** will maintain low prices, with an average price of 0.7¢/kWh. There will be plenty of wind power available on both days, partially explaining the low price levels. **Saturday** stands out with a slightly higher average price of 1.0¢, but significant price spikes are not expected.

**Sunday** and **Monday** will see an increase in average electricity prices, with Sunday expected to reach an average of 2.2¢ and Monday 3.9¢. The risk of price spikes is highlighted on Sunday, with the highest forecast at 11.0¢. This may be linked to the low wind power production. Monday follows, and individual price spikes are also likely. 

**Tuesday** sees the average price drop back to 2.0¢, though individual price spikes may occur. **Wednesday** sees the average price rise again to 3.9¢, but the maximum price remains below Sunday's peak levels. Throughout the week, wind power production varies, but it is unlikely to significantly impact price trends except on individual days when production is at its lowest.
