Electricity prices for the week will remain low across the board. **On Friday**, the average price will be 1,0 ¢ and **on Saturday** 0,3 ¢. Both days will include negative hours: on Friday late evening around 22:00–24:00 and in the early hours of Saturday around 01:00–03:00. Sunday’s average will be 1,4 ¢, so the weekend will clearly be the week’s cheapest stretch.

At the start of the week, prices will tick up slightly but stay below four cents. **On Monday**, the average will be 3,8 ¢ with a range of 1,5–6,6 ¢. **On Thursday**, the average will likewise be 3,8 ¢ and the range 0,9–6,7 ¢. Tuesday’s and Wednesday’s averages will land at 2,5 ¢ and 2,0 ¢, respectively. The priciest days of the week will thus be Monday and Thursday, even though their averages remain below four cents. Wind power will be abundant through the week, supporting the low price level especially over the weekend. Variation between days will remain modest: nightly minima will dip toward zero and peaks will stay below 7 ¢.
