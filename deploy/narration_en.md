The start of the week will be clearly pricier than the end. **On Tuesday**, the week’s highest maximum price, 22,4 ¢, is anticipated, and the average will rise to 13,8 ¢. Wind will be exceptionally weak (min 266 MW), which likely explains a peak in the evening at 18:00–20:00 and a morning bulge at 08:00–10:00. The combination of weak wind and maxima above 15 ¢ means individual peak hours may materialize higher than forecast. **On Wednesday**, spike risk will be pronounced in the morning 08:00–10:00 and, more mildly, in the afternoon 16:00–18:00; the day’s peak is seen at 20,0 ¢ and wind remains low.

Later in the week, the price level will ease. **On Thursday**, the average falls to 9,9 ¢, but a single spike may land in the afternoon 16:00–18:00. **On Friday**, the emphasis shifts to the evening 18:00–20:00, when the day’s 19,6 ¢ peak is anticipated. **On Saturday**, spike risk is noted, but the level stays moderate and the 08:00–10:00 hours rise the most. **On Sunday**, prices will sink to the week’s lowest, averaging 3,9 ¢ and topping out at 5,8 ¢, partly supported by strong wind. Next **Monday** the level will remain low, average 7,6 ¢.
