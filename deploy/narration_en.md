Electricity prices are expected to vary clearly between the end of the week and the start of next week. On **Thursday** the average price would settle at 2,7 ¢ and on **Sunday** at 2,9 ¢; Sunday’s minimum will dip briefly below zero (−0,1 ¢). Sunday falls on a public holiday, which often shows up as a lower price level. **Friday’s** and **Saturday’s** averages, 8,4 and 8,1 ¢, would be notably higher than Thursday’s. **Monday** (10,1 ¢) and **Tuesday** (12,3 ¢) would become the week’s most expensive days. On **Wednesday** the average is projected at 5,0 ¢. The moderate levels on Thursday and Wednesday would be supported by abundant wind output (>3 000 MW on average), while the dearer start of the week would coincide with low-wind days.

There is an explicit risk of price spikes. On **Friday** the highest hours would cluster around 17:00–19:00. On **Saturday** elevated prices are expected in two waves, roughly 08:00–10:00 and 17:00–19:00. On **Monday** the peak would fall mainly at 17:00–19:00. **Tuesday’s** largest spike is expected in the morning at 08:00–10:00, with a peak price of 21,8 ¢; this would be explained by a very low wind power minimum (1043 MW). At other times, the week’s cheapest periods will occur overnight and in the early morning, especially during Thursday’s and Sunday’s hours.
