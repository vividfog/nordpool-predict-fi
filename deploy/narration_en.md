Throughout the upcoming week, electricity prices will fluctuate significantly. **Wednesday** and **Thursday** are expected to have affordable average prices, staying below four cents, standing out due to low wind power production, but no risk of price spikes is forecasted.

**Friday** sees an increase in the average price to 5.8 cents, with a noted risk of price spikes. Variable wind power production partly explains these price fluctuations, and individual price spikes might occur especially during morning and evening hours.

The weekend brings further price volatility. **Saturday** and **Sunday** see average prices rising, particularly on Sunday, when the price reaches 7.2 cents. Sunday's maximum price could rise to as much as 16.8 cents, due to low wind power production and potential price spikes during the afternoon hours.

Next **Monday** and **Tuesday** are the most expensive days of the week, with average prices climbing above 10 cents. Monday's maximum price could be as high as 21.1 cents, making it an especially costly day. Tuesday also carries a high risk of price spikes, particularly between morning and evening when wind power production is minimal.
