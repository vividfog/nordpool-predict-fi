| **Monday** | 11,2 | 7,1 - 15,8 | 994 - 1639 | -1,2 |
| **Tuesday** | 13,7 | 7,8 - 20,8 | 423 - 3029 | -1,2 |

| **Friday** | 3,4 | 2,0 - 5,4 | 3271 - 5747 | 1,9 |
| **Saturday** | 3,4 | 1,8 - 5,1 | 3497 - 5178 | 3,1 |
| **Sunday** | 6,6 | 1,2 - 10,5 | 1468 - 3921 | -0,8 |

Average prices are expected to rise at the start of the week. **Monday**’s average will be 11.2 ¢ with a maximum of 15.8 ¢. **Tuesday**’s average will climb to 13.7 ¢ with an upper bound of 20.8 ¢. **Wednesday** will see the week’s highest average at 15.5 ¢, with a forecast maximum of 21.6 ¢. The risk of price spikes will concentrate on these days: Monday’s peak is estimated around 08:00–10:00, Tuesday’s 07:00–09:00, and Wednesday’s 08:00–10:00 as well as in the evening 17:00–19:00. Low minimum wind output (Mon 994 MW, Tue 423 MW, Wed 1287 MW) explains the higher peak levels on these days.

Later in the week the price level is projected to fall. **Thursday**’s average will be 8.6 ¢. **Friday** and **Saturday** averages will stay at 3.4 ¢. Strong winds from Thursday onward (Thu–Sat averages clearly above 3000 MW) will push prices down. **Sunday**’s 6.6 ¢ average will sit in between: the cheapest hours will fall at night and in the morning, with a gentle rise expected toward the evening.
