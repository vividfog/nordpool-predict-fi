**Thursday** and **Friday**'s price forecasts indicate higher price variability due to low wind power production. Price spikes are expected during morning and evening hours when electricity demand typically rises. On Thursday, prices could climb as high as 14.6 cents per kWh, partly due to low wind power production averaging 884 MW. **Friday** similarly sees even lower wind power, with an expected average price of 7.7 ¬¢/kWh. Price spikes might occur particularly in the morning and evening.

**Saturday** brings notably lower electricity prices, with the average price dropping to 4.4 cents per kWh. Although there is still a risk of price spikes, wind power production is significantly higher. **Sunday**'s electricity price forecast is extremely low, with an average price of just 0.9 ¬¢/kWh. High wind power production helps keep prices down.

**Next Monday**'s electricity price level remains low, with an average price of 1.9 ¬¢/kWh. Wind power production is anticipated to be strong, which partly explains the low price level. **Tuesday** sees prices rising slightly higher again, with an average price of 4.4 ¬¢/kWh, and **Wednesday**'s prices are similar to Tuesday's.

The week is expected to be variable in terms of prices but overall affordable. The risk of price spikes is highlighted at the beginning of the week, but as the week progresses, wind power production and prices stabilize.
