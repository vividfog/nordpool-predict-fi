The start and end of the week will look low, while midweek will be expensive. **On Sunday** the average price will be 0.8 ¢ and **on Monday** 4.7 ¢. Around Wednesday and Thursday the averages will climb to 10.8–12.6 ¢, and the week’s highest maximum, 26.6 ¢, is projected for **Thursday**. **On Friday** the level will ease to 6.0 ¢. **On Saturday** the average will drop to 0.3 ¢; the day’s holiday character will support low levels, and prices will dip below zero for several hours in the early morning, roughly 02:00–09:00.

Spike risk will be pronounced on **Tuesday**, **Wednesday** and **Thursday**. For Tuesday, peaks are projected in the morning 08:00–10:00 and in the evening 18:00–20:00 (forecast maximum 22.5 ¢). On Wednesday, elevated hours are expected 07:00–09:00 and 17:00–19:00 (maximum 23.6 ¢). Thursday’s main peak will most likely fall at 17:00–19:00 (maximum 26.6 ¢). On these days, the realized peak could exceed the forecast. **On Friday** there will also be spike risk in the morning 07:00–09:00, even though the day’s forecast maximum stays at 13.1 ¢.

The price path will be driven by wind variability: abundant output will keep levels low **on Sunday**, **Monday** and **Saturday** (over 3000 MW on average). By contrast, weak wind **on Tuesday**, **Wednesday** and **Thursday** (averages below 2000 MW) will lift prices. In particular, Thursday’s very low minimum wind output, 362 MW, explains the day’s exceptionally high 26.6 ¢ peak.
