Upcoming electricity price forecasts suggest a varying price trend. On **Friday**, the expected average price is 7.0 ¬¢/kWh, but significant price spikes may occur during individual hours. The average wind power production is moderate, which contributes to price stability. On **Saturday**, however, the highest average price of the week, 13.2 ¬¢/kWh, is anticipated, with peak prices potentially reaching 24.9 cents. Low wind power production partially explains the high prices for this day.

On **Sunday**, prices drop significantly from the previous days, with an average price of about 4.0 cents. Wind power production is at a higher level, supporting the decrease in prices. **Monday** maintains moderate prices with no expected risk of price spikes. The average price is about 4.8 ¬¢/kWh, and wind power is abundantly available.

**Tuesday** sees prices rising again, with an average price of 8.8 cents. Wind power production is below average, driving prices up. Wednesday's price level continues in line with Tuesday, with an average price rising to 9.5 ¬¢/kWh. Low wind power production increases the uncertainty in price development.

**Thursday** sees a slight decrease in prices, with an average price of 5.6 cents. Although wind power production is variable, no significant price spikes are expected. Overall, the week presents many price fluctuations, which are particularly reflected during times of low wind power production.
