Weekend prices will stay clearly below four cents. **Friday** is a public holiday, which is expected to lower demand and support a 0.4 ¢ average price. **Saturday** will see brief negative prices, bottoming around 03:00–05:00 at roughly -0.5 ¢. **Sunday** will lift the daily average to 1.9 ¢. Early in the week, the average will climb to 2.9 ¢ on **Monday** and to around 5–6 ¢ on **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**; on single hours, **Tuesday** will exceed 8 ¢ and **Wednesday** will reach roughly 10 ¢.

**Thursday** will stand out as the most expensive day: the average will be 12.5 ¢ and the maximum is forecast at 21.3 ¢. There will be a high risk of hourly price spikes on Thursday, with the peak likely around 16:00–18:00. The day is a public holiday, but the impact will be limited because wind output will be weak (avg 2,200 MW, min 654 MW) and the average temperature will drop to -7.4 °C. The low wind minimum will help explain the higher maximum price.
