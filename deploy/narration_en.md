The start of the week will push prices higher. On **Tuesday** the average is 11,1 Â¢ and individual hours carry spike risk, especially in the evening at 18:00â€“20:00, when the maximum is forecast at 20,2 Â¢. On **Wednesday** the average rises to 14,1 Â¢ and the peak falls in the morning at 08:00â€“10:00 (22,7 Â¢). On **Thursday** a similar risk concentrates in the afternoon at 16:00â€“18:00, with a daily high of 22,8 Â¢. These tighter maxima are explained by very low wind power minima: on Wednesday it drops to 210 MW and on Thursday to 575 MW, clearly below 2,000 MW, which typically shows up as higher peak hours. On **Friday** the average eases to 9,8 Â¢, but individual spikes can still appear in the early evening at 16:00â€“18:00 (15,2 Â¢).

The weekend turns clearly cheaper. On **Saturday** it is a public holiday, so demand may ease and the price is expected to stay around 4,5 Â¢; a possible daily high will likely fall around midday at 10:00â€“12:00 (8,2 Â¢). On **Sunday** the average dips to 3,1 Â¢ and a single high may land in the evening at 17:00â€“19:00 (4,8 Â¢). Next **Monday** the level stays very low, averaging 1,9 Â¢, and at night 02:00â€“04:00 it briefly dips negative (â€“0,4 Â¢). Wind power will be plentiful then, which explains the low prices.
