*The weekend would be moderate; early week would bring price spikes and higher averages, especially Monday–Tuesday, while the end of the week would get clearly cheaper as wind strengthens; Friday looks cheapest.*

|:-------------|:----------------:|:----------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| **Saturday** | 5,8 | 2,6 - 12,7 | 454 - 1195 | 6,4 |
| **Sunday** | 3,1 | 1,4 - 6,5 | 1170 - 3227 | 5,4 |
| **Monday** | 10,0 | 1,3 - 18,2 | 938 - 2758 | 3,1 |
| **Tuesday** | 11,9 | 3,9 - 21,4 | 1162 - 1938 | 1,2 |
| **Wednesday** | 3,8 | 2,2 - 6,1 | 1362 - 4069 | 1,4 |
| **Thursday** | 3,1 | 1,0 - 5,3 | 2410 - 3840 | 1,4 |
| **Friday** | 2,3 | 0,0 - 5,0 | 2374 - 5130 | 2,2 |

An opposite trend would be seen over the weekend: on **Saturday** wind would remain weak (average 786 MW), so the average price would settle near 5,8 ¢. **Sunday** is a public holiday, and the average is expected to stay around 3,1 cents. Individual price spikes could still occur around midday, roughly 11:00–13:00. At the start of the week prices would rise clearly: **Monday** would average 10,0 ¢ and **Tuesday** 11,9 ¢, with peaks above 15 ¢ on both days. Monday’s peak would fall around 17:00–19:00 (max 18,2 ¢) and Tuesday’s around 8:00–10:00 (max 21,4 ¢). Low minimum wind output at the same time (Monday 938 MW, Tuesday 1162 MW) would explain the higher peak levels.

The latter part of the week would level off clearly. On **Wednesday** and **Thursday** averages would stay around 3–4 cents, supporting an inexpensive spell. **Friday** would be the cheapest of the week: average 2,3 ¢, and in the small hours the price would even touch zero. Strong wind from Wednesday onward (over 3000 MW on average, around 4072 MW on Friday) would push prices down through the rest of the week.
