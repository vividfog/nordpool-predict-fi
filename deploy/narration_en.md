| **Sunday** | 1,6 | 0,4 - 3,5 | 3030 - 5657 | 2,3 |

The start of the week will be inexpensive. **Saturday** will have an average price of 0,2 ¢, with brief negative prices during the night and morning hours. **Sunday** will remain moderate, and **Monday** and **Tuesday** will still average under four cents. **Wednesday** will rise to about 5,4 cents. Later in the week the trend turns higher: **Thursday** averages 6,6 ¢ and **Friday** 10,1 ¢, when the week’s highest hourly price, 16,7 ¢, lands in the evening.

The risk of price spikes stands out on Thursday and Friday. Thursday’s peak will most likely fall around 08:00–10:00 (forecast maximum 10,0 ¢). On Friday, the peak will occur in the evening around 17:00–19:00, with 16,7 ¢ forecast. On both days, minimum wind output drops below 2,000 MW (Thu 1,988 MW, Fri 935 MW), which explains the higher hourly prices. On the other days, the price path will be steadier, and the cheapest moments will be during Saturday’s night and morning hours, when levels dip below zero at times.
