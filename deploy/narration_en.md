*Electricity price forecasts for the coming days show some variation, but overall prices are expected to remain reasonable. Prices may rise to higher levels, particularly on Wednesday and Sunday, while the beginning of the week will see more affordable rates.*

Maintenance shutdowns at the Loviisa nuclear power plants may affect the accuracy of electricity price forecasts. Loviisa 1 will be undergoing maintenance starting on September 6, 2025, at 10:00 and is expected to end on September 24, 2025, at 00:00. Meanwhile, Loviisa 2 has been on maintenance since August 17, 2025, at 04:00 and is expected to conclude on September 17, 2025, at 00:00. Due to these shutdowns, forecast accuracy may be influenced by the limited availability of training data.

The forecast was updated on Saturday at 03:20.

Electricity price forecasts for the coming days show some variation, but overall prices are expected to remain reasonable. **Monday** and **Tuesday** are expected to see affordable prices, with average prices slightly above one cent. These days are forecasted to have ample wind power, contributing to the low prices.

On **Wednesday**, the average price is predicted to rise significantly to nearly 5 ¬¢/kWh. Price spikes may occur during the day, especially in the afternoon and evening hours, when prices could exceed 11 cents. This is partly due to the low minimum wind power production. **Thursday** will also see relatively high prices, with a risk of price peaks.

As the weekend approaches, prices are expected to decrease again. **Friday** and **Saturday** will see moderate prices, while on **Sunday**, price expectations rise again, particularly in the evening hours when prices could exceed 15 cents. Sunday's price fluctuations are significant, with wind power production varying greatly throughout the day.
