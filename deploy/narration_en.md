|:-------------|:----------------:|:----------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| **Tuesday** | 7,3 | 3,0 - 13,1 | 678 - 4582 | 0,6 |
| **Wednesday** | 8,3 | 3,2 - 13,5 | 1474 - 4629 | 0,1 |
| **Thursday** | 3,5 | 2,5 - 6,1 | 1748 - 4775 | 1,1 |
| **Friday** | 3,0 | 0,8 - 5,1 | 2868 - 3865 | 2,1 |
| **Saturday** | 4,2 | 1,0 - 10,1 | 1390 - 4419 | 3,3 |
| **Sunday** | 7,3 | 3,0 - 10,5 | 902 - 2322 | 2,9 |
| **Monday** | 11,1 | 6,1 - 18,8 | 821 - 1786 | 2,2 |

The week’s price trend will fluctuate. **Tuesday** and **Wednesday** averages will settle between 7,3–8,3 ¢, then ease to 3,5 ¢ on **Thursday** and 3,0 ¢ on **Friday**. **Saturday** would lift to 4,2 ¢ and **Sunday** to 7,3 ¢. The most expensive day will be next **Monday** with an average of 11,1 ¢ and a maximum of 18,8 ¢. The low levels on Thursday and Friday would be supported by strong wind generation (avg 3442–3552 MW). Monday’s clearly low minimum wind output, 821 MW, would explain the higher maximum price.

Price spike risk is flagged for several days. On **Tuesday**, a spike may hit the morning hours around 07–09. On **Wednesday**, the focus shifts to the evening window 17–19. On **Sunday**, elevated hours would likely land around 15–17. Next **Monday**, the risk is assessed as high, with a peak around 17–19; as the maximum is projected above 15 ¢ and the wind minimum stays below 1000 MW, actual peaks may exceed the forecast.
