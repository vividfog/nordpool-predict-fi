In the coming days, electricity prices in Finland's spot market will vary significantly. **Thursday** and **Friday** will offer relatively affordable prices, with average prices below 6 cents and even negative hours expected. This is mainly due to strong wind power production, which stabilizes price expectations.

**Saturday** and **Sunday** stand out with particularly low average prices, with Saturday's average price being slightly negative. This suggests that the weekend is the most favorable time for electricity users, as wind power production remains at a high level.

Next **Monday**, price developments are moderate, but the projected rise in prices in the afternoon could cause some spikes. **Tuesday** appears to be the most expensive day of the week, with the average price rising above 10 cents and individual price spikes expected in the morning and early evening hours. This is due to weak wind power production, which is below 2000 MW.

Next **Wednesday**, price spikes are also expected, but the average price will be lower than Tuesday's level. This is partly due to variable wind power production and the projected large price difference within the day.
