*Electricity prices are set to fluctuate in the coming week, with potential price spikes on Wednesday and Thursday due to weak wind power production. Prices are expected to stabilize over the weekend, but may rise again on Monday.*

The Loviisa nuclear plants are undergoing maintenance, which may affect the accuracy of electricity price forecasts. The maintenance at Loviisa 1 began on 6.9.2025 at 10:00 and is expected to end on 24.9.2025 at 00:00. Loviisa 2 has been under maintenance since 17.8.2025 at 04:00, with an expected end date of 17.9.2025 at 00:00. Due to limited training data available during maintenance periods, this might impact the accuracy of the forecasts.

The forecast was updated on Monday at 09:07.

The upcoming week's price forecasts show moderate variation, but higher price spikes are expected on **Wednesday** and **Thursday**. On **Wednesday**, electricity prices may rise up to 14 cents during certain hours, particularly in the morning and evening. Weak wind power production, at a minimum level of 950 MW, might drive up prices, potentially leading to price spikes. **Thursday** also sees high price expectations, with a maximum price potentially reaching 14.4 cents per kWh. Wind power production will be at a lower level, which could contribute to higher prices.

Towards the end of the week, prices are expected to even out. On **Friday**, a low average price of about 2.3 cents per kWh is anticipated, marking the lowest of the week. During this time, wind power production is higher, which might partly explain the more affordable prices. On **Saturday** and **Sunday**, price expectations are slightly higher but remain moderate, with no significant price spikes anticipated.

Next **Monday**, electricity prices might rise slightly, with an average forecast of 4.3 cents. Wind power production will be at a reasonable level, but the risk of price spikes remains during certain hours.
