The weekend will start on a low note: **Saturday** will see an average price of 1.8 ¢ and individual night hours will briefly dip negative. **Sunday** will rise to a 3.4 ¢ average yet stay under four cents. Early in the week prices will tighten. **Monday** will average 9.2 ¢ and the day’s peak will reach 17.0 ¢ at 17:00–19:00. The wind-power minimum will fall below 1,000 MW; that explains the spike. **Tuesday** will average 9.4 ¢ and the maximum of 14.8 ¢ will occur around 09:00–11:00; weak wind (min 1,185 MW) supports the higher level.

**Wednesday** will ease to an 8.1 ¢ average, but a local evening high (18:00–20:00) is anticipated, up to 12.2 ¢. Wednesday, **Thursday** and **Friday** are public holidays; demand may be lower than normal. **Thursday** will average 7.9 ¢. **Friday** will be clearly lighter: an average of 1.8 ¢ and a range of 0.8–2.5 ¢. Strong wind (avg 5,868 MW) will weigh on prices. The week’s lowest periods will fall on the weekend, while the highest hours will concentrate in the early-week morning and especially Monday evening.
