Electricity prices are expected to vary significantly throughout the upcoming week. **Monday** starts the week with an average price of 3.4 ¬¢/kWh, with a risk of price spikes during individual hours. Wind power production is at a moderate level but not enough to prevent higher prices at certain times, as indicated by the maximum price.

**Tuesday** will be the most expensive day of the week, with an average price of 4.2 ¬¢/kWh, and price peaks may occur especially during morning and evening hours. Wind power production is at its lowest at 205 MW, partially explaining the higher price expectations.

As the week progresses, **Thursday** sees a decrease in average price to 3.1 ¬¢/kWh, and wind power production is slightly higher compared to earlier in the week, which may help stabilize prices.

**Friday** offers more affordable price expectations, with an average price of 2.6 ¬¢/kWh. Wind power production reaches its highest level of the week, which partially explains the decreasing price. As the weekend begins, **Saturday** sees prices drop significantly. The average price is just 0.8 ¬¢/kWh, with even negative prices possible. Wind power production remains high.
