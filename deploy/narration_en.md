| **Monday** | 9,3 | 3,0 - 16,0 | 1141 - 1989 | 2,2 |
| **Tuesday** | 9,0 | 3,9 - 14,5 | 991 - 2619 | 1,5 |
| **Wednesday** | 7,7 | 3,5 - 12,5 | 2076 - 2890 | -0,1 |

| **Sunday** | 2,9 | 0,2 - 5,4 | 2126 - 4235 | 2,9 |

Prices will be clearly higher early in the week. On **Monday** the average is projected at 9,3 ¢ and the day’s high at 16,0 ¢, timing around 17:00–19:00. The risk of hourly price spikes will be elevated, and a very low minimum wind output (1141 MW) explains the high peak. On **Tuesday** the average is expected at 9,0 ¢ and the top at 14,5 ¢ around 08:00–10:00; spike risk will again be high. A very low wind minimum (991 MW) will also support a higher maximum price.

From midweek onward, price pressure is expected to ease. On **Wednesday** (public holiday) the average is projected at 7,7 ¢ and the peak at 12,5 ¢ around 18:00–20:00; spike risk on individual hours will remain possible. On **Thursday** and **Friday** (public holidays) the level will ease to averages of 5,9 ¢ and 2,8 ¢. Stronger wind later in the week will push prices down, and on **Saturday** and **Sunday** levels will stay low, at 3,4 ¢ and 2,9 ¢. Early Sunday morning will see sub‑1 ¢ hourly prices.
