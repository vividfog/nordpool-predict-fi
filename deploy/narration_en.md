Electricity market prices will vary significantly day by day in the coming week. **Saturday** stands out with its low average price of 0.8 ¢/kWh, with the day's minimum even dipping into negative territory at -0.6 ¢/kWh. This is partly due to high wind power production, which exceeds 2000 MW several times. Prices remain low on **Sunday** as well, although wind power production is weaker than average.

On **Monday**, prices will increase, with the average price reaching 3.1 ¢/kWh. This may be due to a decrease in wind power production, which in turn raises prices. **Wednesday** will see the highest average price of the week at 3.4 ¢/kWh, with the day's maximum reaching 7.3 ¢/kWh. This is due to the low wind power production during the day, which limits electricity supply and raises prices.

The lowest prices of the week will generally occur at night, when wind power is more abundant and demand is lower. During the day, prices rise, especially in the mornings and afternoons when demand is highest. The forecast indicates a risk of price spikes on several days, but particularly on **Wednesday** afternoon, when higher prices should be anticipated.
