Next week’s electricity market will see fluctuating price trends. **Monday** is expected to have higher price levels, with an average price of 6.6 ¢/kWh and a maximum price rising to 16.5 ¢. This might be partly due to weak wind power, with a minimum of only 591 MW. The risk of price spikes is high, especially in the morning from 8-10 AM and in the evening from 5-7 PM.

**Tuesday** sees the average price rising slightly higher to 7.6 ¢. Price spikes are also expected on Tuesday, especially in the morning from 8-10 AM and in the evening from 5-7 PM. Wind power production remains low, which may partly explain the higher prices.

In the middle of the week, prices stabilize. **Wednesday** sees the average price drop to 2.9 ¢, and wind power production is significantly higher, helping to keep prices low. This steady trend continues through **Thursday** and **Friday**, with average prices remaining low at 2.2 ¢ and 1.4 ¢ respectively.

Over the weekend, on **Saturday**, price expectations rise slightly, with an average price of 3.3 ¢. Wind power production is lower, and there is a risk of price spikes, particularly in the evening from 6-8 PM. **Sunday** is expected to have the lowest price levels of the week, with an average price of -0.4 ¢. Wind power production is expected to be at its highest, which partly explains the low prices.
