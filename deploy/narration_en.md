According to the price outlook, the week will start moderately and end at reasonable levels. On average, prices will land in the 3–8 cent range, with variation mainly in weekday morning and evening peaks. On **Tuesday**, the week’s highest average will form at 7,8 ¢, while the averages on **Friday** and **Saturday** will stay around 3–3,5 ¢. The cheapest individual hours will occur late Friday night to early Saturday, when prices will dip to 0,8–1,1 ¢. On **Wednesday**, the highest hourly price of the week, 13,1 ¢, will likely appear around 18–20; this will be explained by the day’s low minimum wind output (below 2000 MW).

The risk of spike prices will appear only on weekdays. On **Tuesday**, a single peak will concentrate in the morning, around 08–10, topping at 12,0 ¢. On **Thursday**, a similar risk will show in the morning rush, around 07–09, up to 8,0 ¢. Tuesday’s higher level will be explained by weak wind (average 2393 MW), whereas the lower averages at the start of the week and over the weekend will be supported by abundant wind output (over 3000 MW on several days).
