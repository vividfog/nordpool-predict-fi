At the start of the week, prices are expected to rise. **Monday** will see the average climb above 11 cents, and the spike risk for individual hours will be focused in the morning around 08:00–10:00 and in the evening 18:00–20:00 (daily peak 16.8 ¢). **Tuesday** the spike risk will fall in the morning 08:00–10:00, when the week’s highest hourly price at 21.9 ¢ is expected, with another lift in the afternoon–evening 16:00–18:00. **Wednesday** the average will remain elevated, and the spike risk will be timed to the morning 08:00–10:00 and early evening 17:00–19:00. **Thursday** pressure will ease, but isolated spikes may still occur in the morning around 08:00–10:00. Tuesday’s exceptionally low wind minimum output, 489 MW, will also explain the week’s highest peak at 21.9 ¢.

The end of the week will turn clearly cheaper. **Friday** the average will stay near four cents, and **Saturday** will remain at the same level. On both days, wind power will be abundant, which will push prices down. **Sunday** the average will edge up to 5.4 cents. The spike risk for a single hour will be concentrated in the early evening around 17:00–19:00, when the day’s peak at 8.7 ¢ will occur.
