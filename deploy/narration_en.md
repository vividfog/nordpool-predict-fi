A split pattern is expected during the week: **Monday** will see the average price rise to 10,9 ¢ and **Tuesday** to 11,7 ¢, with maximums reaching the 18,9–19,0 ¢ range. Peaks will fall on Monday at 17–19 and on Tuesday at 8–10 and 16–18, when the risk of price spikes will be elevated. On both days, minimum wind output will remain very low (773–840 MW), which explains the higher peaks and intraday swings. **Sunday** will be more moderate due to the public holiday (avg 3,8 ¢), with a single uptick around 10–12; the maximum will stay at 6,7 ¢.

**Wednesday** and later in the week, prices will mostly stay below four cents. **Thursday**, **Friday** and **Saturday** will average 3,4–1,9 ¢, and daily maxima will range between 3,3 and 7,0 ¢. Strong winds (averaging over 3000 MW) will push expectations lower from Wednesday onward. The week’s cheapest hours will occur overnight into Saturday at 02–04, when the price will dip to about 0,6–0,7 ¢.
