In the upcoming week's forecast, electricity average prices show moderate variation, but notable price spikes may occur particularly on **Wednesday** and **Thursday**. On **Wednesday**, the forecasted maximum prices may rise to nearly 20 cents, with spikes likely occurring in the morning. **Thursday**, in turn, shows the highest average prices of the week, possibly due to relatively low wind power production.

The most affordable average prices are expected from **Monday** to **Saturday**, with prices generally remaining below six cents. This could encourage electricity consumers to schedule their usage during these days. **Sunday** is also forecasted to have price spikes, particularly in the morning and evening, which could cause temporary price increases.

The week's wind power production appears variable, which partly explains the movements in forecasted prices. **Tuesday** is clearly the windiest day, helping to keep prices low. **Friday**, on the other hand, is forecasted to have the lowest wind power production, which may raise electricity prices, especially in the afternoon hours.
