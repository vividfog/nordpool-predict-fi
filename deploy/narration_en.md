Electricity prices will show considerable variation during the upcoming days. The week's highest prices are expected midweek, especially on **Wednesday**, when the average price will be slightly above five cents. The highest hourly prices approach nine cents on Wednesday evening between 19:00 and 21:00.

On **Thursday**, prices will decrease slightly compared to Wednesday. The day's average price will be around 3.6 cents, but individual hourly prices are expected to rise above nine cents in the morning between 8:00 and 10:00. There is a risk of price spikes during these hours, meaning actual hourly prices may exceed the forecast.

The week's lowest electricity prices are anticipated on **Friday**, when the average price drops exceptionally low, around 0.2 cents. Hourly prices will even become negative for several hours from late Thursday night through Friday morning, reaching as low as -1.3 cents around 5:00 AM.

Prices will also remain low during the weekend. On **Saturday** and **Sunday**, average prices will hover around one cent. Negative hourly prices will occur on both days: Saturday afternoon between 14:00 and 17:00, and Sunday afternoon from 13:00 to 17:00. However, there is a risk of single-hour price spikes on both days, particularly in the morning and early evening hours.

At the start of next week, on **Monday** and **Tuesday**, prices will rise slightly compared to the weekend but remain moderate. Monday's highest hourly price will be around six cents, while Tuesday's highest price will reach only about four cents. The risk of price spikes applies only to Monday, particularly during early evening hours.

Overall, the coming week presents highly variable electricity prices. Consumers should monitor price developments, particularly on Wednesday evening and Thursday morning due to the risk of price spikes, while Friday offers the week's most affordable usage hours.
