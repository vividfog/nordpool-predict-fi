Prices will settle at different levels as the week progresses. **On Wednesday** the average will stay at 2,8 ¢ with a range of 0,2–4,8 ¢; plentiful wind power will support the low level. **On Thursday** the average will rise to 5,8 ¢. **Friday’s** and **Tuesday’s** averages, 8,5 and 8,3 ¢, will be clearly higher. **On Sunday** the average will return to 3,8 ¢. The highest level of the week will likely occur on **Monday**, when the average is 10,8 ¢ and the maximum is projected at 17,2 ¢. The cheapest hours are expected early Wednesday at 00:00–02:00.

Spike risk will stand out especially on Monday. The most expensive hours are estimated around 08:00–10:00 and 15:00–17:00. On Friday a possible spike is slated for 16:00–18:00, and on Tuesday for 10:00–12:00. **On Saturday** there is a public holiday, so demand may be lower than usual; still, a single morning uptick is possible at 08:00–10:00. Very low minimum wind output helps explain the highest peaks: Monday’s minimum stays at 1110 MW and the maximum reaches 17,2 ¢. On Friday the minimum is 1232 MW with a peak of 14,8 ¢; on Tuesday 1366 MW and 14,3 ¢.
