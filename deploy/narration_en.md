|:-------------|:----------------:|:----------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| **Monday** | 10.0 | 2.3 - 17.1 | 824 - 2557 | 3.1 |
| **Tuesday** | 8.8 | 2.0 - 19.9 | 835 - 5378 | 1.2 |
| **Wednesday** | 2.5 | 0.6 - 4.3 | 3083 - 5611 | 1.4 |

| **Friday** | 1.4 | -0.5 - 3.3 | 3253 - 5294 | 2.2 |
| **Saturday** | 2.7 | -0.0 - 5.2 | 3019 - 5108 | 1.1 |

A downward price trend would describe the week from the start toward a very cheap midweek and weekend. **Monday’s** average price would rise to 10.0 ¢ and intraday variation would be wide. **Tuesday** would ease to 8.8 ¢, but the spike risk for individual hours would be high: the peak would likely fall around 07:00–09:00, and the maximum 19.9 ¢ would stand out clearly. From **Wednesday** onward prices would mostly stay below four cents, and on **Friday** the low would even turn negative (-0.5 ¢). **Saturday** would remain low before **Sunday** lifts the average to 6.5 ¢.

Wind power variability would explain the development. **Tuesday** would see very low minimum output (835 MW), supporting the morning spike. From **Wednesday** to **Thursday** and **Friday** production would be clearly stronger than usual, pushing prices close to zero for many hours. On **Sunday** the wind would weaken (1059–3136 MW), and the spike risk would be elevated especially at 17:00–19:00, when a maximum of 15.2 ¢ would be possible.
