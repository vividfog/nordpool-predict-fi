The upcoming week appears to be quite variable in terms of price trends, but no major price peaks are forecasted. **Thursday** is expected to be inexpensive, with an average price of 0.1 cents per kilowatt-hour, and strong wind power production partly explains the low prices. **Friday**, on the other hand, stands out as the most expensive day of the week, with the average price rising to 2.5 cents and potential price spikes occurring during certain hours, especially between morning and evening. Wind power is weaker on Friday, which may contribute to the price increase.

**Saturday** and **Sunday** see more moderate price trends, although Sunday may experience price spikes. On both days, wind power production is relatively steady, and prices are expected to remain reasonable. **Monday** brings slightly higher prices, especially during the afternoon hours when wind power production is lower.

**Tuesday** is the cheapest day of the week with an average price of only 1.0 cents, and higher wind power production may explain the lower prices. **Wednesday** concludes the week with a slightly higher average price, but significant price peaks are not expected.
