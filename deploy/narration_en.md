| **Thursday** | 9,8 | 2,8 - 22,4 | 723 - 1944 | 4,8 |
| **Friday** | 5,2 | 1,0 - 10,5 | 1307 - 3529 | 4,3 |

The start of the week is expected to be inexpensive. **Sunday** would drop to an average of 1,4 ¢, and negative prices would appear overnight. This would be driven by exceptionally strong wind, pushing prices down. **Monday** would remain below a five-cent average, though higher than Sunday.

The clearest shift will occur on **Tuesday**. The daily average would rise to 10,9 ¢ and single-hour peaks would reach 24,4 ¢. Wind output would bottom out at 718 MW, and this low trough would clearly explain the higher peak. Spike risk would be elevated especially at 17–19.

Tighter pricing would continue on **Wednesday** and **Thursday**. Wednesday’s average would be 12,0 ¢ and Thursday’s 9,8 ¢. On both days the wind minimum would stay below 1000 MW (679 MW on Wednesday, 723 MW on Thursday), supporting evening peaks. Wednesday’s high would land around 17–19 (21,0 ¢) and Thursday’s at 16–18 (22,4 ¢).

The end of the week would settle toward a more typical level. **Friday’s** average would be 5,2 ¢. Spike risk for single hours would be noted, likely centered on the early evening 17–19 slot, yet at a more moderate level (max 10,5 ¢). **Saturday** is a public holiday, so demand could be lower than usual, reflected in a 6,8 ¢ average. The wind trough (554 MW) would still be very low, so an elevated spike risk would fall in the afternoon at 16–18, with a peak of 16,4 ¢.

The clearly standout day of the week would be Tuesday, with both the average and the daily maximum the highest. The cheapest periods would be seen during Sunday night and early morning, when the price would dip below zero.
