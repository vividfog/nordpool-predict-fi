At the start of the week, prices will stand out from the rest. On **Tuesday**, the average price is expected to rise to 11,5 cents and the day’s peak is forecast to reach about 20,1 ¢. A risk of single-hour spikes is noted, with the most expensive window expected around 17:00–19:00; elevated levels are also anticipated late morning around 10:00–12:00. Wind power’s minimum output will drop well below 2,000 MW (about 300 MW), which explains Tuesday’s higher peak. On **Wednesday**, spike risk is also present: the peak is estimated around 15,3 ¢, most likely 07:00–09:00. Again, an extremely low wind minimum supports a higher peak versus most other days.

From **Thursday** onward the price level will stabilise clearly lower. Strong winds (daily averages above 3,200 MW) are expected to weigh on prices: average prices remain between 4,0–7,5 ¢ and intraday swings are more modest. The week’s cheapest periods will occur on **Sunday** late evening 21:00–23:00 and **Monday** night 00:00–02:00, when prices drop to roughly 2–3 cents. The most expensive day of the week will be Tuesday, and the highest peak will rise above 20 cents.
