Pricing on **Friday** stands out: the daily average would rise to 14,6 ¢ and the top hour to 25,2 ¢. The risk of a price spike would be high, especially in the evening, 17:00–19:00. A very low wind minimum (329 MW) would explain the peak. **Saturday** is a public holiday, which may ease demand and push prices down; the average is projected at 7,1 ¢. Still, a single spike could land in the morning around 08:00–10:00. On **Tuesday**, spike risk would also be elevated, with the highest hours centered on 10:00–12:00, when the top price is forecast at 15,5 ¢.

The week’s lowest daily averages would be seen on **Sunday** (5,9 ¢) and **Wednesday** (6,4 ¢), supported by strong wind generation. **Monday’s** 9,4 ¢ and Thursday’s 10,1 ¢ would sit near mid-range. The cheapest hours would likely fall on Sunday night and early morning, whereas the clearly priciest moments would occur on Friday evening. On Thursday, the intra-day high would fall around 17:00–19:00, reaching roughly 14,8 ¢.
