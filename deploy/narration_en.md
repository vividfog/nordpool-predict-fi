Electricity prices in Finland are expected to vary significantly across different days this week, with prices predicted to remain very low for most of the week. **Wednesday** stands out with a notably higher average price of 7.1 ¬¢/kWh. This day is also the only one where price spikes are expected, particularly in the morning around 9-11 AM, when prices could rise to as much as 17.9 cents. This high maximum price is associated with low wind power production, which decreases to under 1000 megawatts in the morning.

**Thursday** and **Friday** are forecasted to be exceptionally affordable days, with average prices at 0.4 and 0.7 ¬¢/kWh, respectively. No significant price spikes are expected for these days, and strong wind power production supports the low price level.

**Saturday** and **Sunday** will maintain low electricity prices, but Sunday carries the risk of price spikes in the morning around 7-9 AM and in the evening from 6-8 PM. Sunday's average price is 0.9 ¬¢/kWh. Wind power production remains relatively stable, but on Sunday, it is slightly lower compared to other days of the week.

**Monday** sees a slight increase in electricity prices, with an average price of 1.2 ¬¢/kWh. There is a risk of price spikes, particularly in the morning around 8-10 AM. **Tuesday** prices drop again, with a predicted average price of 0.7 ¬¢/kWh. No significant price spikes are expected on Tuesday, and wind power production remains steady.
