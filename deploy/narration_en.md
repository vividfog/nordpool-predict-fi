Electricity prices will vary next week, but generally remain reasonable. **Thursday** stands out as the most expensive day, with the average price rising to 5.0 cents. This may be partially due to fluctuations in wind power production, with minimum production staying at 1511 MW. In contrast, **Saturday** will be the least expensive day, with an average price of just 0.9 cents and strong wind power production, which could explain the low price level.

On **Sunday**, there is a risk of price spikes, as the predicted maximum price reaches 13.9Â¢, and wind power drops to a low of 1519 MW. This is expected to happen particularly in the evening between 19:00 and 21:00. **Monday** and **Thursday** also carry a notable risk of spikes, which are expected to occur in the evening between 17:00 and 19:00.

Average temperatures for the week will mostly stay between 11.9 - 14.6 Â°C, so the weather will not significantly affect the forecasted prices. On **Wednesday** and **Friday**, price expectations remain quite stable, providing consumers an opportunity to take advantage of moderate prices.
