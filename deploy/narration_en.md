The electricity price forecast will show significant daily variations in the coming days. Particularly on **Friday**, the average electricity price will fall unusually low, even turning negative, with a daily average price of -0.1 cents. Wind power generation will be very abundant on Friday, averaging over 4800 MW, partially explaining the low prices. Night and early morning hours will even see prices reaching as low as -1.4 cents.

On **Saturday**, the situation changes considerably, with the average electricity price rising to four cents. Wind power production will drop significantly, with the day's minimum output falling below 200 MW. This weak wind power partly explains the day's high maximum price, reaching 11.2 cents in the evening between around 19:00â€“21:00. Saturday also carries a high risk of individual hourly price spikes.

On **Sunday**, price expectations are more moderate, averaging around two cents. During the day, negative hourly prices will be observed in the afternoon, but in the evening hours prices will rise above six cents. The risk of individual hourly price spikes remains on Sunday, especially in the evening hours around 19:00â€“21:00.

The start of the new week will again bring slightly higher average prices. **Monday** is expected to be the most expensive day of the week, with an average price of about 4.3 cents and the highest hourly price rising between eight and nine cents in the evening. On Monday, wind power generation will remain at a low level, which may contribute to maintaining higher prices. Monday also carries a risk of price spikes.

**Tuesday and Wednesday** look more moderate regarding prices, with Tuesday's average at 3.3 cents and Wednesday's at 2.3 cents. On both days, wind power generation will slightly recover, helping keep prices moderate. However, Wednesday evening hours could still momentarily push prices above six cents.

On **Thursday**, the average electricity price will rise slightly from previous days, to about 3.4 cents. During the day, higher hourly prices will also occur, especially in the evening, with the maximum price approaching nine cents. Thursday's forecast indicates a risk of price spikes particularly in the evening hours.
