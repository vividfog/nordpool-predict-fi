This week's electricity market price forecasts vary considerably between days. The beginning of the week is relatively calm, but notably higher peak prices are forecasted for Wednesday and Thursday. **Wednesday** stands out in particular, with an average daily price of 8.5 cents and a maximum hourly price climbing above 15 cents. The risk of extreme price spikes is high, especially in the morning from 7‚Äì9 and in the evening from 19‚Äì21. Wednesday‚Äôs high prices are explained by exceptionally low minimum wind power production, dropping as low as 154 MW.

On **Thursday**, electricity prices will also rise somewhat. The day's average price will be 5.2 cents, with the highest prices expected in the morning hours from 8‚Äì10. The risk of price spikes on Thursday is again due to reduced wind power, although not as low as on Wednesday. Nevertheless, clear price increases will occur during the morning hours.

The most affordable day early in the week is **Friday**, when the average electricity price will fall below two cents. Negative electricity prices will also occur early Friday morning between 3‚Äì5, indicating ample electricity production relative to consumption. This is significantly influenced by strong wind power, reaching a high level during the day (over 3500 MW), keeping prices low throughout the day.

On **Saturday**, **Sunday**, and next **Monday**, electricity prices will remain at moderate levels. Average daily prices for these days will range between approximately three and four cents. Individual higher prices will be observed in the evenings, particularly on Saturday from 8‚Äì10 and Sunday from 19‚Äì21. Next Monday also carries a risk of price peaks, especially between 18‚Äì20 in the evening.

Overall, price developments throughout the week are variable, with the most notable differences appearing midweek. After Wednesday‚Äôs and Thursday‚Äôs higher prices, the situation will clearly stabilize approaching the weekend, allowing consumers to benefit from exceptionally low prices on Friday.
