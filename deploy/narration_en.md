| **Wednesday** | 6,2 | 3,5 - 10,3 | 268 - 3674 | 1,5 |
| **Thursday** | 5,5 | 1,8 - 8,8 | 1440 - 3141 | 1,6 |

| **Sunday** | 4,3 | 2,2 - 6,6 | 2881 - 4393 | -0,8 |
| **Monday** | 4,0 | 1,4 - 7,0 | 3521 - 4823 | 1,9 |

Midweek prices are expected to stay moderate, but individual peaks will hit key hours. **Wednesday** the day’s high, about 10,3 ¢, would fall between 08:00–10:00. **Thursday** the peak would occur 16:00–18:00 at roughly 8,8 ¢. **Friday** the top price would be about 13,0 ¢ at 18:00–20:00, and **Saturday** would see a similar 13,0 ¢ around 07:00–09:00. The higher peaks on Friday and Saturday are linked to low wind-power minima (1565 MW and 742 MW), which explains the hourly surges. Wednesday’s exceptionally weak night-time output (min 268 MW) also supports the morning emphasis.

The lowest daily averages will be seen on **Sunday** and **Monday**, at 4,3 and 4,0 ¢. The level will be supported by strong winds above 3000 MW. **Tuesday** the average will rise to 5,9 ¢ but remain close to the week’s baseline. The lowest hourly prices will occur on several nights from Thursday through Tuesday, in places 1,4–2,0 ¢, while Wednesday and Saturday mornings will sit clearly above each day’s average.
