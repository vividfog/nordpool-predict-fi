Throughout the week, electricity prices will vary significantly. On **Monday**, the highest average price of the week, 14.4 Â¢/kWh, is predicted, with prices within the day reaching up to 27.0 Â¢/kWh. This is partly due to the low wind power, forecasted at a minimum of only 214 MW. On **Tuesday**, price expectations decrease, but there remains a risk of price spikes at individual hours, particularly during morning and evening when wind power production can vary greatly. The average price on Tuesday is 8.3 Â¢/kWh.

**Wednesday** sees further reductions in price expectations, with an average of 5.3 Â¢/kWh. Although wind power production is generally higher, there is still a risk of price spikes for individual hours. **Thursday** maintains a moderate price level of 6.8 Â¢/kWh, with steadier wind power production reducing the risk of price spikes.

**Friday** and **Saturday** see further declines in electricity prices, with Saturday particularly offering the lowest average price of the week at just 2.5 Â¢/kWh. However, Sunday presents an interesting twist, as the risk of price spikes returns for individual hours, and the day's average price rises to 5.6 Â¢/kWh.
