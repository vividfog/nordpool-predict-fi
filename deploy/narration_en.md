In the coming week, electricity prices will vary significantly. **Monday** stands out with the highest average price of 6.7 cents, with a maximum price reaching up to 17.4 cents. This is partly due to a low wind power minimum level, which drops to only 563 MW. Monday's price peaks are expected in the evening, between approximately 17:00 and 19:00. **Tuesday** continues with relatively high prices, averaging 8.0 cents. Price spikes may also occur on Tuesday, particularly between 8:00 and 10:00 in the morning.

Forecasts for Wednesday and Thursday show considerably lower prices. On **Wednesday**, the average price is 3.0 cents, and the maximum price remains moderate at 5.8 cents. **Thursday**, on the other hand, offers the lowest average prices of the week, at 2.2 cents, with prices expected to remain very stable throughout the day.

Towards the end of the week, **Friday** and **Saturday** bring slightly higher prices again. Friday's average price is 1.6 cents, while on Saturday it rises to 3.3 cents. There is a possibility of price spikes on Saturday evening, especially between 18:00 and 20:00, when the maximum price reaches 13.2 cents.

Overall, next week presents a wide range of electricity prices, particularly considering the peaks on Monday and Saturday. The production of wind power varies significantly, which in turn affects price fluctuations.
