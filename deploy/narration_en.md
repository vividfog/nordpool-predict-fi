*Electricity prices will fluctuate significantly next week, particularly on Monday and Tuesday, when high price spikes are expected. From Wednesday onwards, prices will decrease and remain low for the rest of the week as wind power production increases.*

There are currently maintenance outages at the Loviisa nuclear power plants. Maintenance activities at the Loviisa 1 reactor began on September 6 at 10:00 and are expected to end on September 24 at 00:00. The maintenance at the Loviisa 2 reactor started on August 17 at 04:00 and is estimated to conclude on September 13 at 00:00. These outages may affect the accuracy of the forecast, as training data from these periods is limited.

The upcoming week shows a variable trend in electricity prices. **On Monday** and **Tuesday**, relatively high prices are expected, partly due to low wind power production and occasional price spikes. On Monday, the electricity price could rise up to 17 cents per kWh, especially around 8 AM and 8 PM. On Tuesday, a similar price spike could be seen around 8 PM, when the price is expected to be at its highest.

**On Wednesday**, prices drop significantly, with an average price of only 3 cents expected for the day. This may be partly due to the increased availability of wind power compared to the beginning of the week. Wednesday's maximum price is expected to be only 6.2 cents, which is considerably lower than on the days at the start of the week.

The cheapest periods of the week fall towards the end, particularly on **Thursday** and **Friday**, when average prices remain below one cent. During these days, strong wind power production lowers the electricity prices. While prices remain low **on Saturday**, they rise slightly **on Sunday**, yet still remain moderate.

Over the weekend, **on Sunday**, individual price spikes may occur, particularly in the afternoon and early evening. This is reflected in Sunday's average price, which is notably higher than on Friday and Saturday.
