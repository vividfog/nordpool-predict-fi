At the beginning of the week, between **Friday** and **Saturday**, electricity prices will remain low. On Friday, the expected average price is 2.5 ¢/kWh, and on Saturday, it drops even lower to 1.1 ¢/kWh. Wind power production is abundant on both days, partly explaining the low prices. On Sunday, electricity prices settle even lower, with the day's average price being just 1.0 ¢/kWh. On these days, the risk of price spikes is negligible.

At the start of the week, **Monday** sees a slight increase in electricity prices, with an average price of 3.5 ¢/kWh. A significant change occurs on **Tuesday**, when the average price rises sharply to 12.6 ¢/kWh. This is clearly due to the reduced wind power production, which averages at 1742 MW. On Tuesday, there is also a high risk of price spikes, particularly during morning and evening hours when prices could increase significantly.

On **Wednesday**, prices remain at Tuesday's level, with an average price of 13.4 ¢/kWh. Price spikes are also expected on Wednesday, mainly due to the particularly low minimum wind power production. Towards the end of the week, on **Thursday**, prices decrease again, with an average price of 8.3 ¢/kWh. However, even on this day, there is a high risk of price spikes.

The week's price expectations show a great deal of variation, with Tuesday and Wednesday standing out due to their high prices and risk of price spikes. This indicates that wind power production will have a significant impact on electricity prices in the coming days.
