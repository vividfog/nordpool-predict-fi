In the upcoming week, electricity price trends will vary significantly. **On Thursday**, the average price is expected to rise to 16.3 cents, and high price spikes are anticipated, especially in the evening. Wind power production remains at a normal level, but minimal production during the day partially explains the high maximum price. **On Friday**, the average price calms down to 8.9 cents, but warnings of individual price spikes remain in effect.

During the weekend, **on Saturday** and **Sunday**, electricity prices are expected to decrease significantly, with average prices at 3.8 and 4.4 cents. Although price spikes are forecast for both days, they will not reach the levels of Thursday. On both days, wind power production remains at a reasonable level, contributing to the moderation of prices.

At the beginning of the week, **on Monday** and **Tuesday**, average prices are once again moderate, at 7.0 and 7.4 cents. A high risk of price spikes has been warned for Monday, with the forecast suggesting that peak hours could occur in the evening. **On Wednesday**, the average price remains at 6.6 cents, but the maximum price rises above 21 ¬¢, making it the highest of the week. Low minimum wind power production may partly explain this higher price.
