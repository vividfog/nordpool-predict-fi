In the coming week, electricity price expectations will vary significantly between different days. **On Wednesday** and **Thursday**, prices are very low, even negative, due to abundant wind power. Wind power production is at a high level on these days, pushing prices down.

**On Friday**, the average price rises to 1.3 cents per kilowatt-hour. This is due to less wind power, averaging only 1763 MW. On Saturday, prices drop again as wind power slightly increases.

**On Sunday**, electricity prices are expected to remain low, but by Monday, prices significantly rise to 2.3 cents per kilowatt-hour. This is partly due to a decrease in wind power and its low average production. **On Tuesday**, the risk of price spikes is high, and prices can rise up to 6 cents per kilowatt-hour.

Among the expected prices for the week, Tuesday stands out with its highest prices and possible price spikes. This is partly due to low wind power production during the day. Price spikes might occur during the night between Monday and Tuesday, so it is advisable to monitor electricity price developments closely on these days.
