A clear range of prices will be seen over the week. The highest daily averages are expected on Monday (12,6 ¢) and Saturday (11,1 ¢). The cheapest day will be Wednesday, with an average of 3,3 ¢ and a range of 2,1–5,8 ¢. The week’s highest single-hour peak will occur on Saturday, with a maximum of 21,4 ¢.

**Saturday** will bring the day’s top price around 08:00–10:00 (peak 21,4 ¢). The intraday wind minimum falls to 905 MW, which helps explain the high morning spike. In the evening, prices will ease back toward the day’s lows (about 5–9 ¢).

**Monday** will carry risks concentrated on individual peak hours. In the evening, around 18:00–20:00, prices may rise sharply (top hour 20,9 ¢), and another expensive window is expected late morning around 09:00–11:00 (about 17 ¢). Behind this is weak wind: the daily average stays at 1790 MW and the minimum at 1061 MW. On **Tuesday**, single-hour risks will also focus on the morning; a clear peak is anticipated around 08:00–10:00 (maximum 19,2 ¢) as the day’s wind minimum remains below 2000 MW.

**Sunday** will stay steadily low, with an average of 5,1 ¢ and a 3,0–7,4 ¢ range. Strong wind at 3729–5330 MW supports the low levels. On **Wednesday**, prices will remain the week’s cheapest; robust wind (3871–4765 MW) underpins the 2–6 ¢ range.

On **Thursday**, isolated upticks may occur in the evening: 18:00–20:00 is expected to be the day’s priciest window (maximum 12,3 ¢). Wind remains low on average (2388 MW), which can support the evening peak. On **Friday**, risk also clusters in the 18:00–20:00 window, when prices reach the day’s highs (maximum 8,8 ¢). At other hours, Friday’s levels should remain moderate.
