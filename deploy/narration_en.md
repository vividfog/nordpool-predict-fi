The week’s price trend will be twofold. Early in the week the level will firm temporarily, but from Wednesday onward prices will broadly drop below four cents. The lowest averages are forecast for Saturday, at 1,9 ¢. On Sunday the level will be slightly higher than late in the week, yet still moderate.

The most distinct day will be **Monday**. The average price is expected at 7,7 ¢, with a range of 2,3–13,5 ¢. According to the forecast, the risk of individual peak hours will be elevated, and the highest hour will fall in the morning between 08–10. The intraday swing will be linked to wind power: minimum output will dip to 1770 MW while the day’s maximum price is the week’s highest. This low wind trough explains the elevated peak.

**Tuesday** will see the average drop to 4,9 ¢, but intraday variation will still be brisk. Around midday, roughly 12–14, prices will climb near the day’s 10,5 ¢ maximum. **Wednesday** will calm notably: the average will fall to 2,0 ¢ and the range will stay within 0,6–4,5 ¢. **Thursday** will remain low at 2,6 ¢ with extremes at 0,6–5,5 ¢.

Toward the end of the week, prices will remain low. **Friday** will average 2,6 ¢ with a range of 0,3–5,5 ¢. **Saturday** will have a narrow band (0,9–2,7 ¢), and the week’s lowest average would materialize then. **Sunday** is expected at 2,8 ¢ with a 0,5–4,4 ¢ range. The cheapest hours will mostly occur at night, while the week’s highest hours are concentrated in early-week mornings.
