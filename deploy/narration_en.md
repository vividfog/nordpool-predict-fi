| **Friday** | 8,6 | 0,7 - 17,7 | 414 - 2688 | 4,5 |
| **Saturday** | 7,2 | 0,2 - 14,4 | 162 - 2010 | 4,5 |
| **Sunday** | 1,0 | -0,5 - 3,2 | 2112 - 5009 | 4,7 |

| **Tuesday** | 3,1 | 0,8 - 5,1 | 2647 - 3550 | 5,0 |
| **Wednesday** | 1,0 | -0,2 - 2,5 | 3609 - 4989 | 6,9 |
| **Thursday** | 3,0 | -0,4 - 6,9 | 2605 - 5408 | 6,9 |

The week as a whole will be fairly inexpensive. **Friday** will stand out with a higher level: the average price will be 8,6 ¢ and the maximum is forecast at 17,7 ¢. The cheapest conditions are expected on **Sunday** and **Wednesday**, with an average of 1,0 ¢ and minimum prices briefly dipping negative (−0,5 ¢ and −0,2 ¢). Strong winds on these days will support the low prices. On **Tuesday** and **Thursday**, prices will also mostly stay below seven cents, with plentiful wind power.

The risk of price spikes will be emphasized on **Friday evening** and **Saturday morning**. On Friday, an extremely low minimum wind output (414 MW) explains the week’s highest maximum price; the spike would likely fall around 18:00–20:00. Saturday is a public holiday, which may ease demand and weigh on prices, but weak winds lift individual hours; the highest hour would likely occur around 09:00–11:00. Sunday’s and Wednesday’s negative moments will occur in the early hours, when winds are strong and demand is low.
