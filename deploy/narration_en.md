The upcoming week offers a diverse price trend for electricity consumers. **Saturday** stands out as the cheapest day of the week, with an average price holding at 2.3 cents, and price expectations ranging between 0.3 and 6.4 cents. This forecast may encourage consumers to schedule their electricity use at the start of the weekend.

On **Sunday**, the average price rises slightly to 3.1 cents. Wind power production is at its lowest at only 150 MW, which may partially explain the slight increase in prices and potential isolated price spikes.

**Monday** and **Tuesday** bring slightly higher average prices, at 4.3 and 4.4 cents respectively. Price fluctuations are expected on these days, particularly during morning and evening hours when consumption typically peaks.

Midweek, on **Wednesday**, the average electricity price rises to the highest of the week at 5.8 cents. This is partly due to wind power production remaining relatively low, which can drive up prices. On **Thursday** and **Friday**, prices decrease slightly but remain above the five-cent average, reflecting the variable wind power production.

The weekend offers some relief for consumers, but prices are expected to be variable. Overall, the forecast for the coming week indicates that electricity prices will remain moderate yet variable. Isolated price spikes are possible, especially at the start and middle of the week, so consumers should closely monitor the situation.
