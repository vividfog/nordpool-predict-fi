| **Monday** | 4,2 | 0,8 - 7,6 | 3151 - 4115 | 4,7 |
| **Tuesday** | 10,8 | 3,2 - 18,5 | 1064 - 2870 | 4,7 |
| **Wednesday** | 13,0 | 6,3 - 22,3 | 398 - 1495 | 5,1 |
| **Thursday** | 10,7 | 4,4 - 16,9 | 604 - 1947 | 4,8 |
| **Friday** | 8,9 | 3,2 - 14,9 | 759 - 1965 | 4,3 |
| **Saturday** | 3,4 | 0,2 - 7,9 | 817 - 3877 | 4,5 |
| **Sunday** | 0,3 | -0,6 - 2,1 | 3358 - 4897 | 4,6 |

Two distinct phases are expected to start the week. On **Monday** the price level will stay low thanks to strong wind (avg 4,2 ¢). On **Tuesday** prices will rise (avg 10,8 ¢), and a single peak is forecast for 17:00–19:00, when the level may reach 18,5 ¢. On **Wednesday** the week will be at its most expensive: the day’s average is 13,0 ¢ and the maximum 22,3 ¢, concentrated in the morning 07:00–09:00. The day’s minimum wind output will fall well below 2,000 MW (398 MW), which explains the higher peak. On **Thursday** spike risk will remain and the peak will fall around 16:00–18:00 (16,9 ¢).

Toward the end of the week the price level should settle. On **Friday** the average will be 8,9 ¢, and the peak will likely occur around 08:00–10:00 (14,9 ¢). **Saturday** is a public holiday, so demand may be lower than usual and the average will dip to 3,4 ¢; an isolated morning spike is still possible around 08:00–10:00 (7,9 ¢). On **Sunday** the week’s cheapest day is expected: an average of 0,3 ¢ and several negative hours before dawn, linked to strong wind throughout the day.
