During the upcoming week, electricity prices will vary significantly across different days. **Tuesday** is expected to have the highest average price of the week at 10.6 ¢/kWh, with the daily maximum price possibly reaching up to 22.0 cents. This is partly due to low wind power production, which remains below 1000 MW for several hours during the day. Tuesday also carries a high risk of price spikes, especially in the evening, when prices might exceed the forecast.

**Wednesday** sees a drop in average electricity price to 5.9 ¢, but the risk of price spikes remains. Thursday, on the other hand, offers very cheap electricity, with the average price staying at just 0.5 ¢, thanks to strong wind power production. This trend continues on **Friday** as well, with a slight rise in average price to 0.9 ¢, yet still remaining low.

Over the weekend, on **Saturday** and **Sunday**, electricity prices remain moderate, but there is a risk of price spikes, especially on Saturday. On Sunday, prices are slightly lower, with the average price staying at 1.0 ¢.

**Monday** sees a slight increase in electricity price but remains reasonable at an average of 2.1 ¢. Wind power production is at a moderate level, helping to keep prices in check.
