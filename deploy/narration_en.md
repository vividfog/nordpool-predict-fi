Price levels will be moderate next week. Average prices will mostly range between 4–7 cents, and the week’s lowest daily average will be seen next **Monday** at 4,2 ¢. Clearly higher will be **Tuesday’s** average, 9,0 ¢. Mid‑week volatility will be slightly larger. Within‑day variation will still stay limited, and the weekly peak, 13,4 ¢, will occur on Tuesday afternoon around 15:00–17:00. The cheapest hours will arrive in the early hours of **Friday**, around 00:00–02:00, when prices dip close to 1 cent.

Spike risk will stand out on **Wednesday** and **Saturday**, especially in the morning. Wednesday’s highest hours will likely fall around 07:00–09:00, and a similar setup will recur on Saturday from 07:00–09:00. **Tuesday’s** higher intraday maximum will be linked to very low minimum wind output: production will dip to 245 MW, clearly below 2000 MW. Toward the end of the week and next **Monday**, wind output will be plentiful (on average over 3000 MW), which will push prices lower and limit daily peaks.
