| **Friday** | 5.7 | 1.8 - 11.4 | 845 - 3274 | 4.3 |
| **Saturday** | 0.5 | -1.8 - 2.5 | 1823 - 3932 | 4.5 |

The week’s price levels will split in two. The start will remain moderate, and on **Monday** the average price will settle around 4.5 cents. Toward the weekend, very low levels will be seen: on **Saturday** there will be a public holiday, which will reduce demand and push prices clearly lower. Overnight hours will likely dip into negative, down to -1.8 ¢ at the lowest. On **Sunday** as well, prices will stay low and negative moments are expected in the early night.

The week’s clearly most expensive days will concentrate on **Tuesday**, **Wednesday** and **Thursday**. Tuesday’s average will rise to 11.6 cents and spike risk for individual hours will be forecast especially at 18:00–20:00. Average wind output will remain low, supporting higher prices. On Wednesday, very low wind (average 971 MW) will likely lift prices further, with spike risk in the evening at 17:00–19:00. Thursday’s forecast will stand out the most: the maximum will reach 27.4 ¢, with the peak around 17:00–19:00. Thursday’s exceptionally low minimum wind output (349 MW) will also explain the highest maximum price.

On **Friday** as well, spike risk for individual hours will be flagged, even though the day’s maximum stays below 12 cents. The higher levels will likely concentrate in the morning, roughly 08:00–10:00. Intraday variation will be large as wind strengthens through the day toward the afternoon.

The week’s cheapest moments will fall in the early night of the public holiday and the adjacent weekend. Higher prices will cluster from Tuesday to Thursday, especially in the evening peaks. The outlook could still change if wind forecasts shift, but based on current data, price variation will be substantial in the middle of the week.
