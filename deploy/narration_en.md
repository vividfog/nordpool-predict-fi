*Electricity prices will vary moderately in the coming week, with Monday standing out due to higher price levels. The affordable weekend prices provide opportunities for savings, while Thursday continues with price fluctuations.*

The electricity prices for the coming week will exhibit moderate variations, but there are notable features to observe. **Monday** has the highest average price of the week at 4.5 ¢/kWh, with significant price fluctuations throughout the day.

Midweek on **Wednesday**, the price level is considerably lower, averaging 2.1 ¢/kWh. This is partly due to strong wind power production, peaking at 2802 MW. However, there is still a risk of price spikes, so consumers should be aware of potential changes.

On **Thursday**, prices rise again slightly, averaging 4.0 ¢/kWh. The daily fluctuation ranges from 1.7 to 7.3 ¢/kWh, which may suggest fluctuating weather conditions or changes in wind power production. Wind power production is at its lowest during the week, which could contribute to the price increase.

During the weekend, particularly on **Saturday** and **Sunday**, the price level is low due to abundant wind power production. The average price on Saturday is 1.9 ¢/kWh and on Sunday 1.7 ¢/kWh, making the weekend a cost-effective time for electricity use.
