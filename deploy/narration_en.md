On Saturday, prices are expected to remain relatively stable, but may rise to as high as 8.5 Â¢/kWh in the evening. Sunday forecasts a slightly higher average price, with potential price spikes in the evening, reaching up to 7.5 Â¢/kWh. This might be due to low wind power production, averaging only 484 MW on Sunday.

On Monday, the price trend continues similarly to Sunday, with a risk of price spikes. In contrast, Tuesday is expected to have significantly lower prices, with an average price of only 1.5 Â¢/kWh, possibly explained by higher wind power production averaging 1884 MW.

On Wednesday, prices may again vary more, and price spikes are possible, especially in the evening. Thursday and Friday maintain a similar price trend, with the risk of price spikes still present during individual hours.

Overall, the coming week offers a varied price trend, with fluctuations in wind power production and potential price spikes playing a key role. *Assessment by gpt-4o.* ðŸ“Š
