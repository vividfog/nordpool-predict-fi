In the upcoming week, the electricity market will predominantly see moderate prices, though individual price spikes may occur. On **Monday**, prices will vary widely, with the highest price potentially reaching 7.2 cents, making it one of the priciest days of the week, even though the average price remains at 2.5 cents. On **Tuesday**, prices are expected to drop significantly, with the forecasted average price at only 0.7 cents, likely due to abundant wind power peaking above 4000 MW.

**Wednesday** and **Thursday** will see slightly higher electricity prices, with average prices at 2.2 and 3.1 cents, respectively. Thursday's highest price could rise to 6.7 cents, possibly due to weaker wind power production. **Friday** is forecasted to have the week's highest maximum prices, reaching 8.2 cents, although the average price stays at 3.4 cents. This could be explained by variations in wind power production.

**Saturday** will again have moderate prices, but the forecast warns of individual price spikes. On **Sunday**, predicted prices are lower again, with an average price of only 0.4 cents, and wind power production is moderate, helping to keep prices low.
