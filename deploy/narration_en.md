An elevated price level will be expected at the start of the week. The clearest outlier will be **Tuesday**, with an average price of 14,4 ¢ and a daily high reaching 24,0 ¢. The backdrop is very low wind generation: the minimum falls to 190 MW, which explains the higher peak. **Monday**’s 9,9 ¢ and **Wednesday**’s 13,7 ¢ will also be linked to weak winds, averaging below 1 000 MW on those days. On **Thursday** and **Friday**, averages will settle between 10,6–13,0 ¢. The weekend will ease: on **Saturday** the average will be 6,4 ¢ and on **Sunday** 4,7 ¢. Sunday’s low level will be supported by abundant wind, averaging 4 095 MW.

Single-hour price spikes are forecast as follows: **Tuesday** morning 8–10 and evening 18–20. **Wednesday** stands out in the morning 8–10 and afternoon 16–18. On **Thursday**, pressure appears 16–18. On **Friday**, peaks could land 15–17 and 17–19. On **Saturday**, the clearest morning uptick sits at 7–9.
