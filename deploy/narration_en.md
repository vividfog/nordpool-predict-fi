|:-------------|:----------------:|:----------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| **Monday** | 4,9 | 1,9 - 7,1 | 3358 - 4920 | 1,5 |
| **Tuesday** | 4,0 | 1,9 - 6,8 | 1800 - 6560 | 2,2 |
| **Wednesday** | 3,9 | 1,1 - 8,0 | 2344 - 6935 | 3,0 |
| **Thursday** | 8,1 | 4,5 - 12,1 | 1621 - 2511 | 3,0 |
| **Friday** | 9,3 | 3,1 - 17,9 | 1111 - 2726 | 2,9 |
| **Saturday** | 4,8 | 2,4 - 8,9 | 1709 - 3923 | 1,8 |

Price expectations for the week will shift toward the end of the week. **Thursday** will see the average price rise to 8,1 ¢ and **Friday** to 9,3 ¢, with the week’s highest hourly price, 17,9 ¢, most likely occurring around 16:00–18:00. The high spike risk is linked to weak wind output: Friday’s minimum drops to 1111 MW, which explains the unusually high maximum. On Thursday the wind minimum will also fall below 2000 MW, and isolated expensive hours will typically land in the morning around 08:00–10:00 and the early evening around 16:00–18:00.

The start of the week will be clearly cheaper. Averages will hover near four cents on **Monday**, **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, and abundant wind will support a moderate level. **Saturday** is a public holiday, which often eases demand; the average will stay at 4,8 ¢. The cheapest day will be **Sunday**, with a 3,2 ¢ average and prices confined to the 2,0–4,0 ¢ range. The lowest individual hours will arrive on early‑week nights around 00:00–04:00 at roughly 1–3 ¢, and early Sunday afternoon will also offer stretches below three cents.
