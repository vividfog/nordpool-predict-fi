The upcoming week will bring fluctuating electricity prices. **On Friday**, the highest average price of the week is expected at 14.1 cents per kilowatt-hour. This is partly due to low wind power production combined with a high maximum price reaching 24.4 cents. **On Saturday** and **Sunday**, prices drop significantly, with Sunday's average price being particularly low at just 2.1 cents, thanks to strong wind power production.

At the start of the week, **Monday** and **Tuesday** are expected to have more stable electricity prices, around 4.5 - 4.8 cents per kilowatt-hour. **Wednesday** sees a slight increase in prices, with an average of 6.5 cents, but Thursday brings back a higher price level at 10.6 cents. The highest maximum price of the week is reached on Thursday, with a rise to 17.4 cents.

Price spikes are possible over the weekend, particularly on Friday and Saturday during individual hours. These spikes may occur in the morning or evening hours. Variations in wind power production significantly affect this week's price forecasts, as wind power is particularly strong on the week's cheapest days.
