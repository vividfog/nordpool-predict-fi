The weekend is expected to be even and generally inexpensive. **Friday**’s price will stay near zero, with an average of 0,3 ¢. **On Saturday** one hour will dip slightly negative, but the daily average will settle at 2,2 ¢. **Sunday** will average 3,5 ¢. The low level will be supported by strong wind power production through the weekend.

The sharpest rise will arrive early in the week. **On Monday** the average price will be 9,2 ¢ and the peak is projected at 16,7 ¢. The risk of price spikes will be high, with the top likely around 17:00–19:00. Wind power’s minimum will fall below 2000 MW, which aligns with the higher peak. **On Tuesday** the average will be 9,1 ¢ and the peak 15,2 ¢, with the spike risk around 09:00–11:00. **Wednesday** and **Thursday** are holidays, which typically lightens demand and shows up as more moderate levels (6,8 ¢ and 4,8 ¢).
