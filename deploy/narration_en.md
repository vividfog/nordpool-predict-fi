*Next week's electricity market expects fluctuating prices as low wind power production and maintenance outages impact costs on different days. Tuesday will be the cheapest, but price spikes may occur especially on Wednesday and Thursday.*

The Loviisa 1 nuclear power plant is undergoing maintenance starting on September 6, 2025, at 10:00, and is expected to end on September 24, 2025, at 00:00. Loviisa 2 is also undergoing maintenance, starting on August 17, 2025, at 04:00 and ending on September 17, 2025, at 16:00. These maintenance outages could affect the accuracy of the forecast as training data is limited during outages.

The forecast was updated on Monday at 14:25.

The upcoming week's electricity prices will vary significantly across different days. **Tuesday** starts with a low average price of 1.9 ¢/kWh, but price spikes may occur in the evening, especially between 19:00 and 21:00. On Wednesday, prices are on the rise, with an average of 4.8 ¢. This is partly due to low wind power production levels, ranging from 1200 MW to 3068 MW. High prices are also expected on Thursday, with an average price of 5.2 ¢, and a risk of price spikes, particularly during the morning hours.

**Friday** offers slightly cheaper electricity, with an average price settling at 4.0 ¢. As the weekend approaches, on **Saturday** and **Sunday**, prices continue to fall, with average prices at 3.3 ¢ and 2.8 ¢, respectively. More wind power is expected over the weekend, which partly lowers prices.

Next **Monday**, prices rise again, and the average price is 4.6 ¢. Price spikes are anticipated during the morning and evening hours, particularly between 9:00-11:00 and 19:00-21:00.
