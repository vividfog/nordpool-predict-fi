On **Friday**, the electricity market is expected to see significant price fluctuations, with the highest price potentially reaching 23.0 Â¢/kWh. This is partly due to low wind power production, which will be at a minimum of 476 MW. On Saturday, prices will drop significantly, with the average price expected to be only 4.0 Â¢/kWh, as wind power production is abundant, reaching up to 3028 MW. However, on **Saturday**, prices can vary during individual hours, so price spikes cannot be completely ruled out.

**Sunday** is expected to have moderate price levels, with an average price of 5.4 Â¢/kWh. Wind power production is variable, which may affect price fluctuations throughout the day. On **Monday**, prices will rise slightly from Sunday, with an average price of 6.5 Â¢/kWh. Wind power production is at an average level, but price variations are possible.

**Wednesday** and **Thursday** are expected to have higher average prices, at 8.5 and 10.7 Â¢/kWh, respectively, and particularly on **Thursday**, the price may rise to as much as 20.7 Â¢/kWh. Wind power production is lower, contributing to the higher prices. On these days, price spikes are possible, particularly during evening hours.
