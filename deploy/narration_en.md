The electricity price forecast for the coming week indicates notable daily variations. The most affordable day in terms of exchange electricity will be **Monday**, with an average price around half a cent. Particularly in the early morning hours, electricity prices will even dip into negative territory, reaching as low as -1.1 cents.

The highest average price of the week is expected on **Wednesday**, reaching 4.2 cents. On that day, prices are projected to fluctuate considerably within the day. Around eight o'clock in the morning, the price is expected to peak at around 10 cents. **Tuesday** will also see substantial price variation, and in the evening hours between 19:00‚Äì21:00, there will be a significant risk of high price spikes, with forecasts suggesting electricity prices could exceed 10 cents during these hours. Tuesday's wind power production will drop exceptionally low at times, explaining the high peak prices.

On **Thursday** and **Friday**, the price situation will stabilize somewhat. Thursday's average price will remain moderate at around 2.5 cents, and no significant spikes are expected. On Friday, the average price will decrease further to 1.8 cents, with negative prices again expected during nighttime hours. However, on Saturday, prices will rise again, with the daily average climbing slightly above three cents. On Saturday evening between 19:00‚Äì21:00, electricity prices will approach nine cents, posing an increased risk of price spikes.

The week concludes on Sunday with an average price of 2.4 cents. Prices remain moderate between early morning and afternoon, but after eight o'clock in the evening, prices will rise above five cents. Again, the risk of price spikes will occur during certain evening hours.

Throughout the week, price fluctuations will be primarily related to significant variations in wind power production. The lowest prices correspond to days with abundant wind power, while the highest peaks coincide with times when wind power production is exceptionally low.
