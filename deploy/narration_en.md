The electricity price forecast for the week ahead anticipates clear variations. Early in the forecast period, prices will reach higher daily averages, whereas prices will decrease significantly toward the end of the week. However, hourly prices could rise sharply at certain times.

On **Thursday**, the average electricity price will be 7.4 cents, with a maximum price close to 15 cents occurring in the evening between 20:00 and 22:00. Wind power production on Thursday will average below 1000 megawatts, explaining the higher price level. The risk for price spikes will be elevated especially in the morning between 07:00 and 09:00, and again in the evening from 19:00 to 21:00.

On **Friday**, the price level remains high with an average price of 7.8 cents. Morning and evening hours will again be the most expensive, with peak prices exceeding 14 cents expected between 08:00 and 10:00 and again from 19:00 to 21:00. Wind power production will remain low on Friday as well, contributing to elevated prices and higher risk of price spikes.

**Saturday** stands out due to the week's largest price variation. Although the day's average price declines to 3.7 cents, the highest hourly price of the entire week—nearly 17 cents—will occur between 07:00 and 09:00 in the morning. On Saturday, wind power generation will increase significantly during the day, explaining both the morning price spike and the subsequent decrease later in the day. The risk of price spikes remains high in the morning.

On **Sunday**, electricity prices will drop notably to an average of 1.2 cents. The day's highest price reaches only 2.7 cents, and wind power output remains high throughout the day. While price spikes may occur during individual hours, they will remain moderate.

Next **Monday** and **Tuesday** prices will remain affordable, with both days expected to experience negative minimum prices during nighttime hours. Monday's average price is 1.6 cents, and Tuesday's is 1.7 cents. High wind power output supports low prices on both days. Price spikes may occur at individual hours but will be relatively low.

On **Wednesday**, prices will remain moderate, averaging 2.3 cents. Wind power generation will continue at a normal level. Hourly price risks will be minor but still possible.
