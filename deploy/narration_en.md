In the upcoming week's forecast, **Friday's** price expectations stand out from other days. The average is the highest at 15.4 ¢/kWh, and the maximum price could reach up to 28.7 ¢/kWh. Low wind power figures in the morning and a high maximum price could pose a risk of price spikes, particularly during the morning hours, such as between 8-10.

**Thursday** and **Wednesday** are also expected to see higher electricity prices. Thursday's average price is 8.5 ¢/kWh, and the average wind power production is lower, which could contribute to price increases. On Wednesday, the maximum price might be as high as 15.4 ¢/kWh, potentially leading to spikes in the morning between 8-10 and in the evening between 18-20.

On Saturday, Sunday, and next **Monday**, prices are expected to be lower, with average prices at 2.2, 3.3, and 2.5 ¢/kWh. These days benefit from higher wind power production, supporting lower prices. Especially on Saturday, wind power is strong, keeping prices low throughout the day.
