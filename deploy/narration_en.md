The week’s overall picture is set to remain inexpensive: all days’ average prices will stay under four cents. **Thursday’s** average would be the highest of the period, 3.3 ¢, and **Saturday’s** clearly the lowest, 1.4 ¢. Differences should remain moderate, as daily maxima mostly fall between 3 and 6 cents. Strong wind generation throughout the period would broadly explain the low price level; wind power is expected on most days to be well above 3,000 MW.

Within the day, the priciest hours will typically cluster around the morning and evening demand periods, while night and early morning will remain clearly below the daily average. Particularly cheap moments are anticipated in the small hours of the weekend, when prices will come close to just a few tenths of a cent. On weekdays too, night and pre-dawn prices will stay low, and daytime prices will be subdued early in the week as well, even if a few individual hours see somewhat higher readings.
