| **Friday** | 16,2 | 7,7 - 25,4 | 529 - 1579 | -3,2 |
| **Saturday** | 8,1 | 6,0 - 10,6 | 1151 - 4534 | -1,7 |

| **Tuesday** | 14,6 | 7,4 - 24,2 | 679 - 2578 | -1,2 |

| **Thursday** | 15,8 | 9,9 - 22,5 | 562 - 1046 | -3,4 |

Price expectations will vary clearly over the week. The most notable will be on **Wednesday** with an average price of 17,9 ¢ and a daily peak of 27,4 ¢; the minimum wind output will drop to 583 MW, which explains the higher peak. Also on **Thursday** and **Friday** average prices will rise to the 15–20 ¢ range, which will be very expensive on a weekly scale. The cheapest day will be **Sunday**, when the average price will dip to 5,4 ¢ and wind power will be abundant.

Spike risk will stand out particularly in single hours: on **Friday** at 17–19, on **Tuesday** at 18–20, on **Wednesday** at 18–20 and on **Thursday** in the morning at 07–09. On Saturday the spike risk is noted, and elevated hourly prices will be concentrated in the evening around 18–20. On **Monday** a short-lived morning peak will be seen at 08–10. No spike risks are reported for Sunday. Weak or even calm winds on several days (especially Tue–Thu as well as Friday) will support intra-day swings and higher peaks.
