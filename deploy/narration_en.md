The week’s price level will be mostly low. Stronger winds early in the week will push prices down: on **Sunday**, **Tuesday** and **Wednesday** averages will hover around a cent, and **Friday** and **Saturday** will also remain low. On **Monday** the average will rise to 4,2 cents but will stay below five. The clearly standout day will be **Thursday**: the day’s average will climb to 5,1 cents and individual hours are forecast to peak at 13,5 ¢. The high peak will be explained by an unusually low minimum wind output (around 1 000 MW).

In terms of timing, Thursday’s most expensive hours will fall between 17:00–19:00, with the peak in the middle of that window. As a counterpoint, negative prices are expected on several nights: on **Tuesday** late evening and **Wednesday** early night prices will dip clearly below zero, and in **Saturday’s** small hours they will briefly turn negative. During daytime, prices will mostly stay below four cents, except for Thursday evening.
