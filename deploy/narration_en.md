The upcoming week will bring varying electricity prices. **Tuesday** and **Wednesday** stand out with slightly higher average prices, around 6.3 ¢ and 6.5 ¢. These days are also forecasted to have a risk of price spikes, especially during morning and evening hours. Tuesday's highest hourly price could reach up to 13.8 cents, while on Wednesday, the maximum price is predicted to be as high as 15.0 ¢.

The weekend days, **Saturday** and **Sunday**, are predicted to be considerably cheaper, both with an average price of 1.3 ¢.
