*The week splits in two: the weekend will be inexpensive, from Tuesday to Thursday prices will rise clearly, and peak hours will often cluster in the morning and evening.*

Over the weekend the overall price level will remain generally low, with Saturday’s average at 2.6 ¢ and Sunday’s at 2.8 ¢. A sub‑four‑cent daily average will also be seen on Friday and next Monday. The most expensive stretch of the week will concentrate from Tuesday to Thursday: Tuesday averages 9.6 ¢, Wednesday 13.5 ¢ and Thursday 14.6 ¢, and on these days individual peaks will also climb markedly.

**Friday** prices will rise in the afternoon, with the day’s highest hour falling in the 15:00–17:00 window (peak 11.0 ¢). This will show up as intraday variability even though the average remains moderate.

**On Saturday** price variation will remain narrow at 1.3–3.9 ¢. **On Sunday** the lower bound will touch zero and the upper bound will stay at 5.7 ¢; strong wind (avg. 3499 MW) supports the low level.

**On Monday** the average will settle around six cents, with a clearer higher moment in the morning at 08:00–10:00 (peak 9.6 ¢). **On Tuesday** decidedly higher hourly prices are expected, especially in the evening at 17:00–19:00 (peak 20.4 ¢). The day’s minimum wind output will be very low (611 MW), which explains the higher maximum price.

**On Wednesday** and Thursday the price level will rise to the week’s highest and single-hour spike risk is assessed. On Wednesday the focus will be the morning 07:00–09:00 and evening 17:00–19:00 (daily peak 22.6 ¢). On Thursday similar peaks will also fall around 07:00–09:00 and 17:00–19:00 (daily peak 24.4 ¢). On both days wind will remain at near‑calm levels (daily minima 824 MW and 612 MW), a strong backdrop for the high maximum prices.

The week itself will split into two clear phases: the weekend and the start of the week will be inexpensive, whereas from Tuesday onwards prices will shift into a more expensive bracket and evening peaks will rise above 20 ¢.
