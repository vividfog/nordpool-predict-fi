*Electricity prices are expected to remain mostly moderate in the coming week, but the high prices predicted for Wednesday stand out. Wind power production significantly influences price trends, and individual price spikes may occur during the week.*

Maintenance outages are currently taking place at the Loviisa nuclear power plants, which began at Loviisa 1 on September 6, 2025, at 10:00 and are expected to end on September 24, 2025, at 00:00, and at Loviisa 2 on August 17, 2025, at 04:00 and are expected to conclude on September 13, 2025, at 00:00. These maintenance outages may affect the accuracy of the forecasts because historical data from maintenance periods is limited.

Electricity prices are expected to remain mostly moderate in the coming week, but on **Wednesday**, a significant price increase is anticipated. The average price is expected to reach 5.9 cents, with the maximum price rising to 15.6 cents. This day stands out clearly from others, whose average prices remain below four cents.

At the beginning of the week, **Thursday** and **Friday** maintain low price levels, with average prices at 1.1 and 0.8 cents. Wind power production is strong on these days, partially explaining the low price levels. On **Saturday** and **Sunday**, price fluctuations increase, and on Sunday, individual price spikes are expected. The maximum price on Sunday rises to 11.5 cents, although the day's average price remains at 2.8 cents.

Prices on **Monday** and **Tuesday** remain reasonably low, but on Wednesday, higher prices and price spikes are a risk. Individual peak hours may occur, especially in the evening. Variations in wind power production are also evident, and Wednesday's high maximum price combined with low minimum wind power production may raise prices for individual hours higher than predicted.
