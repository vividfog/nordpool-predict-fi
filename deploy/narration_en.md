In the upcoming week, electricity prices are expected to fluctuate between different days. **Wednesday** will see relatively affordable prices, with an average price of 4.5 ¢/kWh. Wind power generation is at a high level on Wednesday, partially explaining the affordable price.

**Thursday** is expected to see a price increase with an average price of 6.1 ¢/kWh. There is also a risk of price spikes during certain hours on Thursday, partly due to low wind power production in the morning and evening hours. **Tuesday** is anticipated to have the highest average price of the week at 7.8 ¢/kWh, and there is also a risk of price spikes, particularly during morning and evening hours.

The cheapest prices of the week are expected on **Friday** and **Sunday**, with average prices remaining below 3 ¢/kWh. On these days, wind power generation is at a moderate level, partially explaining the low prices. **Saturday** and **Monday** will also have moderate prices, with average prices at 2.2 ¢/kWh and 3.1 ¢/kWh, respectively.

Throughout the upcoming week, wind power significantly influences price developments, especially on Thursday and Tuesday, where variations in production can substantially raise prices during certain hours. On these days, electricity consumers should be mindful of potential price spikes.
