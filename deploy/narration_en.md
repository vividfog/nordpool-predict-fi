The price forecast for the week shows some variation, but no major anomalies. **Wednesday's** average price of 4.5 ¬¢/kWh is the highest of the week, and on the same day, wind power production drops to a low of only 125 MW at times, explaining the higher price level. On **Tuesday** and **Friday**, maximum prices rise to 7.9 and 7.5 ¬¢/kWh, which could lead to price spikes during specific hours, particularly in the morning and evening.

The cheapest periods of the week are **Saturday** and **Sunday**, with prices even dropping into negative territory on Sunday at -0.2 ¬¢/kWh. On Saturday, strong wind power production helps push prices down. **Monday** also sees a moderate average price of 1.8 ¬¢/kWh, but price spikes may occur, particularly in the morning and evening.

Overall, the lowest prices are expected over the weekend and early in the week, while Wednesday stands out as the most expensive day. The low prices on **Saturday** and **Sunday** result from strong wind power production.
