Price levels are expected to vary by day. **Monday** averages 2,3 ¢ and **Saturday** 2,6 ¢, so early week and the weekend will look inexpensive. Low prices will be supported on these days by plentiful wind generation. **Tuesday** will rise to a 7,5 ¢ average and a 12,9 ¢ daily high, the week’s highest; this is explained by weak wind, with a minimum of just 978 MW. **Wednesday** will still show wide variation (2,2–12,8 ¢), while the average settles at 6,9 ¢. Later in the week the level will even out: **Thursday’s** average will be 5,4 ¢ and **Friday’s** 4,6 ¢, while **Sunday** will land at 4,3 ¢.

The week’s priciest hours will concentrate on **Tuesday** morning, most likely around 08–10, when prices exceed 12 ¢. A price-spike risk is also indicated for this day. **Thursday** may also see isolated higher hours, roughly around 18–20, when the day’s peak is 7,1 ¢. The cheapest moments will fall on **Saturday** around 05–07, when prices dip below one cent. **Monday** midday, around 12–14, will also drop below two cents.
