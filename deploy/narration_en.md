The cheapest average prices of the week will be expected on **Sunday** and **Saturday**, when the averages will settle at 10.5 and 11.3 cents. On Saturday, wind power will be forecast to be abundant, and the price will dip below 10 cents in the evening, with the cheapest hours falling roughly between 19:00 and 23:00. On **Tuesday**, the week’s highest single-hour price will be expected, and the peak will settle roughly between 15:00 and 17:00, when wind power will be weak and frost will still persist.
