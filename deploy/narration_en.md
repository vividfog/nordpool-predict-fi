**Saturday** stands out in the week's forecast with a high average price reaching 10.4 cents. The maximum for the day, 20.4 cents, also indicates potential price spikes. At the same time, wind power production is at a very low level, especially early in the morning. This combination could lead to individually high-priced hours.

**Sunday** is expected to be the most affordable day of the week, with an average price of just 3.6 cents. Wind power is forecasted to increase significantly, which could help keep prices low. However, compared to Saturday, the likelihood of price spikes on Sunday is lower, though they could occur during specific hours.

**Monday** continues with low price levels, with an average price of 3.9 cents. Wind power is expected to be stronger, which helps stabilize prices and reduces the risk of price spikes.

**Tuesday** and **Wednesday** see price expectations rising again, with Tuesday's average price at 5.9 cents and Wednesday at 7.1 cents. Wind power production is at a low level on both days, which may drive prices up. Especially on Wednesday, the maximum price might rise to 16.2 cents, indicating potential price spikes.

**Thursday** offers more affordable price expectations again, with an average price of 3.3 cents. Wind power production is expected to be abundant, which could help keep prices in check, though individual price spikes could occur.
