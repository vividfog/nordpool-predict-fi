*Next week, the spot electricity prices will vary significantly across different days due to fluctuations in wind power production, offering affordable moments especially on Tuesday, but also posing a risk for individual price spikes on Wednesday and Thursday.*

The forecast for spot electricity prices was updated on Saturday at 21:06.

| **Monday**   | 3.5 | 1.0 - 6.8 | 562 - 2111 | 18.0 |
| **Tuesday**  | 0.9 | 0.1 - 2.9 | 1595 - 3068 | 18.2 |
| **Wednesday**| 2.7 | -0.0 - 6.5 | 811 - 2132 | 18.8 |
| **Thursday** | 2.9 | 1.3 - 5.4 | 895 - 1231 | 19.2 |
| **Friday**   | 3.3 | 1.5 - 5.3 | 870 - 1210 | 19.7 |

The first period to consider is **Sunday**, when the average electricity price is expected to be 3.6 ¬¢/kWh, with a minimum price of 1.1 ¬¢ and a maximum price of 5.7 ¬¢. Wind power production varies between 171 MW and 1218 MW, which can partly affect price fluctuations throughout the day. **Monday** offers a very similar price trend, but prices are expected to reach as high as 6.8 ¬¢, which is higher than on Sunday. This may result from fluctuations in wind power production, as wind power peaks at 2111 MW and drops to 562 MW.

On **Tuesday**, price expectations decrease significantly, with an average price estimated at only 0.9 ¬¢/kWh. This is likely due to strong wind power, ranging from 1595 MW to 3068 MW. On **Wednesday**, prices rise again, with the maximum price potentially reaching 6.5 ¬¢. This could be due to low wind power, which drops to 811 MW. There is a risk of price spikes on Wednesday, particularly during the morning and evening hours.

Towards the end of the week, on **Thursday**, the average electricity price is 2.9 ¬¢/kWh. Although wind power production is lower, the risk of price spikes remains possible. **Friday** is expected to follow a similar price trend to Thursday, but fluctuations in wind power production may again affect the prices during individual hours. **Saturday** concludes the week, with electricity prices remaining moderate, and the average price at 2.1 ¬¢/kWh. Wind power production is expected to remain relatively stable.
