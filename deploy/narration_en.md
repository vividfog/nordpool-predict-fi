At the beginning of next week, electricity prices will remain moderate, especially on **Monday** and **Tuesday**, with average prices staying below two cents. On these days, wind power production is stronger, positively influencing prices. **Wednesday** will see prices starting to rise, with the average price climbing to 4.4 cents per kilowatt-hour. During this day, wind power production is considerably weaker, which might explain the increase in prices.

Midweek, on **Thursday** and **Friday**, prices will remain stable, but the upward trend continues toward the weekend. **Saturday** will witness the highest prices of the week, with an average price rising to 11.7 cents. On this day, wind power production will be at a minimum of only 533 MW, explaining Saturday's high maximum price of 26.4 cents. This day also carries a high risk of price spikes.

As the week concludes on **Sunday**, prices will decrease slightly but remain at a higher level with an average of 8.0 ¬¢. Price spikes are also expected on Sunday, particularly during morning and evening hours. In the coming week, the electricity price trend appears variable, and price spikes should be anticipated, especially during the weekend.
