*Next week, the prices of electricity on the market will vary significantly, especially on Saturday and Tuesday, when the risk of price spikes is high. Wind power production fluctuates greatly, which in part affects the expected price variations.*

Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is undergoing maintenance, which started on September 20, 2025, at 1:00 AM and is expected to end on October 10, 2025, at 1:00 AM. The Loviisa 1 nuclear power plant is also under maintenance, beginning on September 6, 2025, at 10:00 AM and ending on October 2, 2025, at 12:00 PM. These maintenance outages may affect the accuracy of the forecasts, as training data from maintenance periods is limited.

The forecast was updated on Wednesday at 9:12 PM.

In the upcoming week, the prices of electricity on the market will vary significantly across different days. **Saturday** stands out as the most expensive day, with an average price of 16.5 ¢/kWh and a maximum price reaching 29.2 ¢. This is partly due to the low wind power production, which ranges from 192 MW to 1937 MW. A higher average price of 9.7 ¢ is also expected on **Friday**, with a notable risk of price spikes.

The most affordable prices are expected on **Thursday** and **Sunday**, with averages below 7 ¢/kWh. On these days, wind power is expected to be stronger, which could partly explain the lower prices. On **Sunday** afternoon, wind power is at its peak, potentially lowering average prices.

**Tuesday** and **Wednesday** also show elevated average prices, at 12.3 ¢ and 11.1 ¢ respectively, and the risk of price spikes is present. The maintenance outages in the nuclear power plants may affect the accuracy of the forecast, but their impact is difficult to assess precisely.
