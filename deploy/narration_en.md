Weekdays will look costlier than the start and end of the week. On average, prices will sit between 10.3–13.3 ¢ from Monday to Friday, while **Sunday** averages 5.7 ¢ and **Saturday** 6.3 ¢. Price spikes are anticipated on several days: on **Wednesday** morning around 08–10 a peak of 20.6 ¢ is projected, on **Friday** evening 18–20 up to 19.9 ¢, and on **Tuesday** morning 07–09 around 18.6 ¢. On **Monday** the morning (08–10) may reach 16.3 ¢, on **Thursday** early evening 16–18 about 15.9 ¢, and on Sunday evening 17–19 roughly 14.0 ¢.

The price level will be supported by weak winds early in the week: in particular, on **Monday** average wind power falls to 827 MW, a calm level. **Wednesday**’s exceptionally high peak likely reflects a very low wind minimum (838 MW). The cheapest hours of the week cluster in the early hours of Sunday, when prices drop clearly below two cents at 00–02, and on Saturday evening, where many hours stay under 5 ¢.
