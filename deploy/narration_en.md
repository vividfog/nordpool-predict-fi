The upcoming week brings interesting changes in electricity prices. **Thursday's** forecasted average price is 2.8 cents, but price spikes can occur, especially around 9 a.m. when the price rises to 8.2 cents. This is partly due to low wind power production in the morning. **Friday** sees a slight rise in the average price to 4.2 cents, and the risk of price spikes remains. Wind power production is occasionally very low, affecting prices.

On **Saturday**, the average price is expected to drop to 2.4 cents, but price spikes can still occur at certain hours. On **Sunday**, prices are the lowest of the week, with an average of just 1.6 cents, though the risk of spikes is not ruled out. **Monday**'s average price is forecasted at 3.9 cents, and wind power production remains at a lower level, which may increase the price.

On **Tuesday**, the average price is 3.3 cents, and wind power production continues at a moderate level. **Wednesday** sees a drop in the average price to 2.3 cents, with slightly higher wind power production. No significant price spikes are forecasted for Wednesday.
