*Spot electricity will remain very inexpensive from Thursday to Sunday, but early next week prices will rise and spike risks will appear due to weak wind.*

|:-------------|:----------------:|:----------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| **Thursday** | 2,5 | 1,3 - 5,2 | 1964 - 6834 | 1,1 |
| **Friday** | 0,8 | -0,0 - 2,4 | 4295 - 6887 | 2,1 |
| **Saturday** | 1,7 | -0,3 - 6,4 | 1892 - 6732 | 3,3 |
| **Sunday** | 2,0 | 0,5 - 3,2 | 4002 - 4823 | 2,9 |
| **Monday** | 8,4 | 2,3 - 15,2 | 1210 - 3983 | 2,2 |
| **Tuesday** | 9,8 | 4,5 - 15,7 | 1219 - 1943 | 1,5 |
| **Wednesday** | 11,2 | 5,1 - 19,1 | 1036 - 1876 | 0,5 |

A clear split will be seen in price expectations. Low-cost power will be anticipated from **Thursday** to **Sunday**, with average prices holding at 1,7–2,5 ¢. The cheapest day will be **Friday**, average 0,8 ¢. On **Saturday** the lowest hours will dip below zero, around -0,3 ¢ at 06:00–08:00. Strong wind generation from Thursday to Sunday will support these low levels.

After the weekend, the level will rise. Next **Monday** the average will be 8,4 ¢ and there will be spike risk for individual hours, with the most likely peak at 17:00–19:00 (up to 15,2 ¢). On **Tuesday** the average will increase to 9,8 ¢ and the risk hours will fall at 08:00–10:00 (15,7 ¢). On **Wednesday** it will be a public holiday, but weak wind will keep the spike risk elevated; the peak will fall at 17:00–19:00 with a maximum of 19,1 ¢ expected. These high intraday maxima will be explained by particularly low minimum wind output: on Monday and Tuesday it will stay below 2000 MW and on Wednesday only 1036 MW, which will be a clear background factor for Wednesday’s daily maximum.
