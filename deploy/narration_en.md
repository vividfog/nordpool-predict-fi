*Next week, electricity prices will remain moderate in the early part of the week due to strong wind power production, but by the end of the week, prices will rise, especially on Friday and Saturday, when wind power production weakens.*

Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance. Its nominal capacity is 1600 MW, but the available capacity is currently 0 MW. The maintenance started on 20.9.2025 at 01:00 and is expected to end on 10.10.2025 at 01:00. The Loviisa 1 nuclear power plant is also under maintenance. Its nominal capacity is 496 MW, and the available capacity is 0 MW. The maintenance began on 6.9.2025 at 10:00 and is expected to end on 29.9.2025 at 12:00. These maintenance periods can affect the accuracy of the forecast as there is limited training data available from times of maintenance.

Forecast updated on Saturday at 21:08.

Electricity prices will fluctuate moderately in the coming week, but the average prices on **Friday** and **Saturday** are higher compared to the beginning of the week. In the early days of the week, electricity prices are expected to remain low, especially on **Sunday** and **Monday**, with average prices below one cent. This is largely due to strong wind power production, which is well above 3000 MW at the beginning of the week.

Towards the end of the week, particularly on **Friday** and **Saturday**, electricity prices will rise significantly, with average prices exceeding five cents. This is partly due to decreased wind power production, which falls below 3000 MW on **Saturday**. Additionally, **Saturday** is expected to see the highest maximum price of the week at 10.7 cents, occurring in the evening between 7-9 PM.

The week indicates that variations in wind power production and nuclear power maintenance affect the general price trend. The most affordable moments of the week are in the early part of the week, while prices rise slightly higher towards the end of the week.
