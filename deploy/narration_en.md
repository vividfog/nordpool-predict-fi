In the coming week, electricity prices will vary significantly across different days. On **Wednesday**, higher prices are expected, with an average price reaching 10.0 cents, and the daily maximum price could rise up to 19.0 cents. This may be due to weak wind power production, as the day's minimum production is only 1112 megawatts, which is clearly below the usual level.

On **Thursday** and **Friday**, prices are significantly lower, with average prices at 4.9 and 2.0 cents. On these days, wind power production is at a higher level, which partly explains the lower prices. On both days, wind power production rises above 4000 megawatts, which is significantly more than on **Wednesday**.

The weekend, **Saturday** and **Sunday**, brings very low electricity prices, with average prices settling at 0.2 and 0.6 cents. Wind power production remains strong, which helps to keep price levels low. On Sunday, negative prices are expected during some hours, which is a rare occurrence.

Next **Monday** and **Tuesday**, electricity prices rise again, and particularly on **Tuesday**, high maximum prices are expected, reaching up to 21.0 cents. A high risk of price spikes is also mentioned on these days, indicating that price fluctuations could be significant. Wind power production is weaker on these days, which partly explains the price increase.
