The start of the week will look inexpensive: **Tuesday’s** average price is expected at 4.8 ¢ with a 2.2–9.4 ¢ range. **Wednesday** will average 4.1 ¢ (1.7–6.6 ¢). Wind output will be plentiful early in the week, weighing on prices: average production will be 3693 MW on Tuesday and 5707 MW on Wednesday. Intraday variation will remain moderate.

Later in the week prices will rise. On **Thursday** the average will be 9.2 ¢ and the maximum 15.0 ¢, with spike risk for individual hours around 16:00–18:00. Weak wind (min 1287 MW) will partly explain the higher peak. **Friday’s** average will climb to 10.7 ¢ with an 18.2 ¢ top; spikes will tend to occur around 17:00–19:00. The wind minimum will drop to 1046 MW, which correlates with the peak hours. On **Saturday** (public holiday) the average will be 7.1 ¢, and increases will be seen in the morning around 09:00–11:00. On **Sunday** an average of 5.9 ¢ is expected, but there will be a risk of higher prices in the evening (17:00–19:00). Next **Monday** the average will be 9.4 ¢ and the high 13.6 ¢, with risk in the morning at 08:00–10:00; wind will remain low. Price expectations may still shift if the wind forecast changes.
