The upcoming week's electricity market will see varying price trends. **On Thursday**, the electricity prices are expected to range between 1.0 ¢ and 14.4 ¢, with an average price of 5.9 ¢. Wind power production is moderate, which helps stabilize prices.

For **Friday** and the weekend, prices remain low, with average prices at just 3.4 ¢ on Friday and 1.4 ¢ on both Saturday and Sunday. During these days, the abundant wind power production explains the low prices. Especially on Sunday, prices are expected to drop to zero ¢ during certain hours.

**On Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, however, higher prices are anticipated, with average prices at 10.5 ¢ and 13.3 ¢. Particularly on Tuesday, the risk of price spikes is increased, with the maximum price potentially reaching up to 22.6 ¢. This is partly due to the low wind power production, which is expected to be just 1371 MW on Tuesday. On Wednesday, the minimum wind power level drops to 889 MW, explaining the high maximum price.

Next week thus offers a variety of price fluctuations, with Tuesday and Wednesday standing out due to high prices and the risk of price spikes. The lower weekend prices, however, provide a respite for electricity users.
