The forecast for next week's electricity market prices shows significant variation between days. **Saturday** is expected to see higher prices, with an average of 13.5 ¢/kWh, ranging from 6.5 ¢ to 24.3 ¢. This may be due to low wind power production, which reaches a minimum of 247 MW. High prices are also expected during certain hours, such as between 18:00 and 20:00, potentially leading to price spikes.

On **Sunday**, prices are expected to decrease, with an average of 6.4 ¢/kWh, which is significantly more affordable than on Saturday. Wind power production increases significantly on Sunday, which may contribute to lower prices. However, the risk of price spikes remains.

**Monday** appears to be the cheapest day of the week, with an average price of just 3.7 ¢/kWh. Strong wind power production helps explain the low prices. On **Tuesday**, prices remain low, although the range is wider, from 0.6 ¢ to 8.9 ¢. This may be partly due to variations in wind power production.

**Wednesday** is expected to have stable prices, with no mentioned risk of price spikes. **Thursday** sees prices rise again, with an average of 7.9 ¢/kWh. Wind power production is slightly lower, which may drive prices up. The week concludes with **Friday**, where the average price is 10.1 ¢/kWh, and price spikes may occur.
