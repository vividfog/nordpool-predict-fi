The price outlook for electricity in the coming days will show notable variation. Particularly around the weekend, clear differences will appear within daily prices. Between Thursday night and Friday morning, prices will even drop into negative territory. Indeed, the entire **Friday** will have an expected average price of -0,2 cents per kilowatt-hour, with the lowest hourly prices falling to -1,4 cents early in the morning between 3:00 and 6:00. The negative prices are attributable to abundant wind power production, which will peak over 6200 megawatts during Friday.

The week's highest prices will occur on **Monday**, when the average price will reach 4,2 cents and the maximum hourly price rises to 9,6 cents per kilowatt-hour. Monday's highest hourly prices will occur between 19:00 and 21:00. Low wind power production, dropping at times below one thousand megawatts, will contribute to the higher price level.

**Saturday** will also exhibit significant price fluctuations. The day's highest price will reach 8,8 cents/kWh around 20:00. On Saturday, wind power production will be generally low, explaining the price increases during evening hours. On **Sunday**, prices will remain more moderate, averaging 1,6 cents, yet hourly prices will still vary widely, ranging from -0,2 cents to over five cents.

In the beginning of the coming week, especially on **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, electricity prices will remain at moderate levels, around 3‚Äì4 cents. On Tuesday, intra-day price differences will be smaller, as wind power availability will be above average, stabilizing prices. On Wednesday, prices will move somewhat higher, and isolated price spikes may occur, particularly in the morning between 8:00 and 10:00, when prices approach eight cents.

Overall, in the coming days, consumers will have opportunities to benefit from low and even negative nighttime prices, especially before the weekend. On the other hand, it will be advisable to prepare for some higher-priced hours, typically clustered around consumption peaks in the early evening and morning.
