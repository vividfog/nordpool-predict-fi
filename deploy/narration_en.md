The electricity price forecast for the coming week is expected to vary significantly between days. **Sunday** appears to be the most affordable day, with an average price of about 0.8 cents. There is a plentiful supply of wind power, which contributes to the low prices. **Monday** is expected to see slightly higher prices, but they remain moderate, with an average price of 4.0 cents.

**Tuesday** highlights the largest price fluctuations, with the average price rising significantly to 13.9 cents. Wind power production is particularly low, which partly explains the higher prices. Tuesday also stands out with its high maximum price of 28.3 cents, and the risk of price spikes is considerable, especially in the morning and evening. **Wednesday** sees prices slightly decrease, with an average of 8.9 cents, but the risk of price spikes remains.

**Thursday** offers more affordable prices again, with an average price of 2.7 cents, thanks to the abundant supply of wind power. **Friday** sees prices rise to a higher level again, but still remain below ten cents. **Saturday** ends the week with higher prices, with the average rising to 8.2 cents, and the risk of price spikes is high once again.

This forecasts the price development for the coming week, where Tuesday, in particular, stands out for its price fluctuations and spikes. *Analysis conducted today by gpt-4o.* ðŸ“Š
