Monday’s higher price level will be supported by very calm wind conditions, as the minimum wind output is forecast at 566 megawatts. Frost will also continue, as the average temperature is expected to remain below -5°C every day.

**Tuesday** is a public holiday, and demand is expected to be potentially lower than normal, which may push the price down.
