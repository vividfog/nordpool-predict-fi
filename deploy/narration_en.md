*According to the forecast, the weekend will remain inexpensive, but after the start of the week prices will rise clearly, and Tue–Thu single-hour spike risks will stand out in places.*

A production shortfall is currently reported in nuclear power: Olkiluoto 1 will operate at reduced output (available 470 MW; 52.8%). The disturbance began on 22 Oct 2025 at 02:00 and is expected to end on 23 Oct 2025 at 15:00. The end time is an estimate.

The forecast was updated on Thursday at 12:00.

The overall picture for the week will diverge clearly: the weekend will look inexpensive, while midweek will rise to a distinctly higher level. Tuesday will stand out the most, with an average of 10.0 ¢ and single hours reaching 22.8 ¢. On Wednesday and Thursday, average prices will be even higher than on Tuesday.

**On Friday** prices will average 6.7 ¢. A spike risk is assessed for single hours, with the most pronounced window in the afternoon around 16:00–18:00. Another clearly pricier spell will appear in the late morning, but the evening peak will be the likeliest.

**On Saturday** the price level will remain low throughout the day. **On Sunday** very low prices will also be anticipated, and the small hours will come close to zero (0.1–0.5 ¢). Sunday’s broad wind output will likely explain the particularly low average.

**On Monday** the average will rise again to 6.3 ¢. The spike risk for single hours will lean to the evening, most likely 18:00–20:00. Wind levels will be low, which may lift evening peaks.

**On Tuesday** price variation will increase markedly. The day’s lowest wind output will be 741 MW, and the week’s highest maximum price, 22.8 ¢, will occur the same day. The spike risk will be concentrated in the evening, 17:00–19:00, and the late evening will also stay clearly above the daily average.

**On Wednesday** the average will rise to 12.4 ¢. Spikes will be anticipated both in the morning, 07:00–09:00, and in the afternoon, 16:00–18:00. Minimum wind output will remain below 2,000 MW, which will partly explain the higher peaks. **On Thursday** the level will be among the week’s highest (avg 13.5 ¢), and very low wind output will accentuate spike risk in the morning, 08:00–10:00, and in the evening, 16:00–18:00.

This is a price forecast, so actual outcomes may still change, especially if the wind forecast is updated.
