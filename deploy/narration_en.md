*On the electricity markets this week, price fluctuations are significant, with Wednesday and Thursday standing out due to higher average prices and the risk of price spikes. Over the weekend, prices drop considerably, offering more affordable periods for consumers.*

The week's electricity markets appear diverse, as expected prices vary significantly across the days. **Wednesday** stands out with a particularly high average price of 4.3 ¢/kWh and a risk of price spikes. This is partly influenced by the low minimum wind power production, which may raise intra-day prices. **Thursday** presents a similar situation, with large variations in wind power that could lead to price spikes during the day.

The most affordable times of the week are on **Saturday**, with an expected average price of just 1.7 ¢/kWh, and on Sunday, where the price averages down to 1.0 ¢/kWh. **Sunday** could even see prices momentarily go negative, which is rare. This is partly due to the abundant wind power production, which pushes prices downward.

The highest expected maximum price of the week occurs on **Wednesday** morning, when electricity prices may rise to 7.8 ¢/kWh before dropping in the afternoon. **Monday** sees prices rise again close to 6.2 ¢/kWh, particularly during the evening hours. This could impact consumer costs if the forecasts hold true.
