The week’s price level will remain mostly in the low–normal range. The clearest outlier is expected to be **Friday**: an average price of 9,4 ¢ and a maximum of 17,8 ¢ are projected. Friday’s evening peak would fall around 18:00–20:00, and the risk of an isolated spike will be elevated. An exceptionally low wind-power minimum (987 MW) will likely explain this. **Saturday** is expected to average 6,8 ¢, with any spike risk tilting toward the morning around 07:00–09:00. **Sunday** will be the week’s lowest, averaging 3,2 ¢, with prices dipping below two cents in the small hours.

At the start of the week, **Monday** is expected to average 4,2 ¢; the cheapest hours are projected overnight around 1,8–2,2 ¢. **Tuesday** is set for a 6,7 ¢ average with a top of 10,1 ¢. **Wednesday** is estimated at 8,0 ¢ on average, with a pronounced early-evening peak around 17:00–19:00 (max 13,1 ¢). **Thursday** is expected to see a 12,2 ¢ maximum, with a possible peak likewise around 17:00–19:00. Strong wind on Sunday and Monday will support low prices.
