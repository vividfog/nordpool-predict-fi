The upcoming week's electricity market provides interesting insights into price trends. **On Saturday**, price expectations are at their lowest, with an average price of just 1.7 ¢/kWh. Within the day, prices may vary significantly, as the forecasted price may even drop to negative. Wind power production varies widely on Saturday, which may explain the price fluctuations.

**On Sunday**, the average price rises slightly, and the maximum price could reach nearly 9.2 ¢. Monday and Tuesday are expected to have relatively stable prices, with average prices of 2.7 and 2.5 ¢. On Wednesday, the average price further increases to 3.0 ¢, and price variation within the day is significant, which may be due to fluctuations in wind power production.

**Thursday** stands out during the week with the highest average price of 4.6 ¢/kWh, and the maximum price rises to 9.4 ¢. This may be due to the low minimum production of wind power. **Friday** continues with higher price levels, with an average price of 4.3 ¢, and price peaks may occur in the evening.

Based on these forecasts, electricity prices will vary significantly throughout the week, with Thursday appearing to be the most challenging day of the week in terms of high prices.
