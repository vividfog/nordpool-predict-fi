*Next week's wholesale electricity prices will vary significantly, with Monday presenting the highest prices and the latter part of the week offering exceptionally affordable electricity usage opportunities due to strong wind power.*

The Loviisa 2 nuclear power plant is undergoing maintenance. Its nominal capacity is 496.0 MW, but the available capacity is 0 MW. The maintenance began on August 17, 2025, at 04:00 and is expected to end on September 9, 2025, at 00:00. The Loviisa 1 nuclear power plant is also undergoing maintenance with the same nominal capacity and availability. Its maintenance began on September 6, 2025, at 10:00 and is expected to end on September 24, 2025, at 00:00. These maintenance outages may affect the forecast's accuracy due to limited training data available from such periods.

In the coming week, wholesale electricity price trends offer several interesting features. **Monday** is expected to see the highest average price of the week at 7.7 ¬¢/kWh, with the maximum price potentially reaching up to 17.0 cents. This is particularly due to weak wind power production, which falls to a minimum of 353 megawatts. This creates a risk of price spikes, especially during the morning and early evening hours.

On **Tuesday**, the price level stabilizes somewhat, although fluctuations are still expected as the average price drops to 5.1 ¬¢/kWh. Price spikes are possible, even though wind power production is slightly higher compared to Monday.

On **Wednesday**, the price level returns to a very reasonable rate, with an average price of just 2.3 ¬¢/kWh. Wind power production is at a normal level, which helps stabilize the price. This day offers more affordable electricity usage opportunities without significant risk of price spikes.

Towards the end of the week, from **Thursday** to **Saturday**, exceptionally affordable electricity deliveries are expected. Average prices remain below 0.5 cents, making these days attractive for electricity consumption. Especially on Saturday, the minimum price may drop to even -1.3 cents, which is an exceptionally low level. Strong wind power explains these low prices.
