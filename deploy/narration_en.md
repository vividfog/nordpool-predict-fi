In the upcoming week's electricity price forecasts, significant fluctuations can be observed between different days. **Friday** stands out with the highest average price of 12.0 ¢/kWh, and price spikes are expected, particularly between 8-10 AM, when prices may exceed 20 ¢/kWh. This price fluctuation is coupled with low minimum wind power production, which might explain the higher price expectations.

**Saturday** and **Sunday** offer significantly cheaper electricity, with average prices at 3.1 ¢/kWh and 3.5 ¢/kWh. On these days, strong wind power production helps keep prices low. However, there is a risk of individual price spikes on both days, especially on Sunday morning.

**Monday** and **Tuesday** are projected to remain in a moderate price range of 4.5 - 4.6 ¢/kWh, without significant anomalies in wind power production or temperatures affecting prices. **Wednesday** sees a slight increase in average price to 6.7 ¢/kWh, with potential afternoon price spikes.

The week concludes with **Thursday**, where the average price rises to 8.3 ¢/kWh. Although wind power is at a low level, the highest price expectation is in the evening between 6-8 PM, when prices may exceed 15 ¢/kWh, creating a risk for price spikes.
