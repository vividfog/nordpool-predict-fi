The week's price trends appear varied, but no major deviations are expected. **Tuesday** is forecasted to have the highest average daily price at 11.3 ¢/kWh, with expected prices ranging from 0.6 to 29.7 cents. This may be due to the low minimum wind power production, which is only 844 MW. **Wednesday** and **Thursday** are expected to see price spikes during certain hours, which could temporarily increase prices. **Thursday** has the highest average price of the week at 14.3 ¢/kWh, partly due to low minimum wind power production combined with a high maximum price.

**Friday** and the weekend are expected to offer slightly lower average prices, although individual price spikes may occur. **Friday**'s average price is 7.0 ¢/kWh, and **Saturday** and **Sunday** prices are even lower at 6.1 and 5.2 ¢/kWh. The forecast highlights Sunday's lowest daily minimum at 2.5 ¢/kWh, which may encourage increased consumption by electricity users.

Next **Monday** is expected to see moderate prices, with the day's average price at 6.4 ¢/kWh. Although wind power production varies significantly, its impact on price is not deemed decisive according to the forecast.
