The upcoming week's electricity markets appear variable, particularly on Wednesday, when the highest average price of 11.3 ¬¢/kWh is expected. On the same day, there is also a risk of price spikes, especially during morning and evening hours. Weak wind, averaging below 2500 MW, contributes to Wednesday's higher price levels. **Tuesday's** price trend is also notable, with the day's maximum price rising as high as 23.8 cents, though the average price remains at 8.7 cents.

The most affordable prices of the week will be seen on **Saturday** and **Sunday**, with average prices of 0.3 ¬¢/kWh and -0.1 ¬¢/kWh. Wind power production is expected to be strong on these days, supporting the low price levels. **Friday's** average price also remains low at 3.1 cents, without significant price spikes, making it one of the most affordable days of the week.

**Monday** again poses a risk of price spikes, with the day's maximum price potentially rising to 17 cents, especially during afternoon and evening hours. Variations in wind power production could influence Monday's price trend, with minimum production dropping to 1164 MW.
