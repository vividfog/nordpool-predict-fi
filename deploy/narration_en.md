In the coming week, electricity prices are expected to fluctuate, but most days are projected to remain moderate. **Thursday** stands out with an exceptionally low average price of just 0.1 ¢/kWh, thanks to strong wind power production reducing price pressures. **Tuesday** also offers a low average price of 1.9 ¢/kWh, although it does not reach Thursday's level.

**Sunday** may see higher prices, with a maximum price potentially reaching 9.1 ¢/kWh, the highest of the week. This is partly due to low wind power, especially during morning and evening hours. **Monday**, on the other hand, sees the highest average price of the week at 3.7 ¢/kWh, driven by weak wind power and variable weather conditions.

While there is a risk of price spikes during the week, especially in the morning and evening hours, **Thursday** poses no such risk. On other days, such as **Friday** and **Saturday**, price spikes are possible, but their impact is likely to be minor compared to Sunday's higher prices.
