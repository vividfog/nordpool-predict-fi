The week begins with quite a variation in electricity markets. **Tuesday** stands out as the highest-priced day of the week, with an average electricity price of 14.4 cents/kWh and a peak price potentially reaching 33.3 cents. Wind power production is at its lowest at 280 MW, which may contribute to the price increase. **On Wednesday**, prices drop to an average of 7.7 cents, but there is a risk of price spikes during specific hours in the morning and evening. Wind power production increases significantly compared to Tuesday, which may help lower prices throughout the day.

**Thursday** and **Friday** appear to be the most affordable days of the week, with average prices at 1.1 and 1.5 cents/kWh. Wind power is forecasted to be abundant on Thursday, explaining the lower prices. Over the weekend, prices remain low, with **Saturday**'s average price predicted to be just 0.4 cents and **Sunday** at 2.1 cents. However, there is a slight risk of price spikes on Sunday, especially in the morning and evening.

Next **Monday**, prices are expected to remain low, with an average price of 0.8 cents. The beginning of the week thus continues to be affordable, offering appealing opportunities for consumers.
