The period will start on **Thursday** with very low price levels. The daily average will be 1,6 Â¢, and during several night and early-morning hours prices will hover around zero. Toward the end of the period the price curve will rise clearly and then ease again after the start of next week. Based on the averages, the lowest levels are expected on Thursday and Wednesday, the highest on Friday and next Monday.

On **Friday**, volatility and price dispersion will stand out. The daily average will climb to 11,5 Â¢, and the highest hourly prices will cluster in the morning: the spike risk falls at 09â€“11, with a projected maximum of 22,1 Â¢. Wind power minimum output will drop to 507 MW and average 1762 MW, which explains both the higher average and the exceptionally high maximum.

On **Saturday**, the average will settle at 9,8 Â¢, but a few costlier hours are expected in the morning. The spike risk is placed at 08â€“10, and the dayâ€™s top hour is 15,3 Â¢. Intraday variation will be large, as wind output dips to 879 MW at its lowest.

The start of the week will continue on the expensive side: **Monday** is expected at 10,6 Â¢ on average. An evening peak will occur at 17â€“19, with a projected maximum of 16,7 Â¢. **Tuesday** will also carry a risk of spikes in the morning at 08â€“10, with a maximum forecast of 17,6 Â¢. On both days the wind minimum stays below 2000 MW (Monday 1208 MW, Tuesday 1512 MW), consistent with the higher peak hours.

Sunday and **Wednesday** will remain clearly lower in level: Sundayâ€™s average will be 6,4 Â¢ and Wednesdayâ€™s 3,9 Â¢, with no exceptionally costly peak hours anticipated. The low levels on Thursday and Wednesday will be linked to abundant wind power, averaging over 4000 MW.
