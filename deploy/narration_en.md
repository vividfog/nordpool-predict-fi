*In the upcoming week, electricity market prices are expected to fluctuate, but overall remain moderate. Variations in wind power production influence the week's price expectations, with a risk of price spikes especially at the beginning of the week.*

As September draws to a close, the electricity markets appear modest throughout the week, but differences between the days are noticeable. **Friday** and **Saturday** stand out with slightly higher average prices of 5.5 and 6.0 Â¢/kWh. On both days, the risk of price spikes is assessed as possible, and wind power production is generally at a lower level, partly explaining the higher price expectations.

**Sunday** sees the week's lowest prices, with an average price of only 2.9 Â¢/kWh. Wind power is expected to be slightly more abundant than on Saturday, which may help keep prices lower. **Monday's** forecasts indicate a return to higher price levels, at 5.5 Â¢/kWh, and the risk of price spikes remains.

**Tuesday** presents a more moderate day in terms of prices, with an average of 4.2 Â¢/kWh. On Wednesday and Thursday, prices drop significantly, and the risk of price spikes is very low. Wednesday's average price is forecasted at 1.3 Â¢/kWh and Thursday's at 1.5 Â¢/kWh, marking the most affordable times of the week.

While some price fluctuations are expected during the week, the overall picture remains relatively stable. It seems that increased wind power production later in the week helps keep prices low.
