The start of the week will remain moderate. From **Tuesday** to **Saturday** average prices will mostly stay below four cents, and on several days the level will touch zero or dip below it at times. The week’s clearly higher overall levels will likely occur on **Sunday** and **Monday**, when averages are forecast at 3,5 and 5,2 cents and maxima at 7,2 and 9,4 ¢.

On **Tuesday** the day’s peak will land in the morning, around 8–10, when the high of 7,5 ¢ is reached. On **Wednesday** exceptionally low night and early-morning hours will appear; around 2–4 the forecast turns negative, and the day’s range stays within -0,3…1,8 ¢. On **Thursday** the pattern will continue, with a negative trough around 2–4.

**Friday’s** range (0,6–3,2 ¢) will remain narrow without pronounced hourly peaks. On **Saturday** the average will ease to 0,3 cents. Negative hours will fall in the early morning and afternoon: around 3–5 and 15–17 prices will briefly dip below zero, while the day’s upper end will stay near two cents.

On **Sunday** the level will rise from the weekend lows. Weak wind (wind power minimum 1522 MW) and a low production floor will explain the higher individual hours, and price spikes may occur in the morning around 7–9 and in the evening around 17–19, with readings up to 7,2 cents. Next **Monday** the upward trend will continue: the average will climb to 5,2 cents and the day’s high will be seen in the evening around 18–20 (peak 9,4 ¢). Intraday variation will be clearly larger than early in the week.
