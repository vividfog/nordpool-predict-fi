| **Wednesday** | 0,6 | -0,2 - 1,8 | 5092 - 6372 | 5,0 |
| **Thursday** | 1,2 | -0,7 - 2,7 | 3420 - 6051 | 6,3 |
| **Friday** | 1,6 | 0,1 - 2,9 | 2459 - 4111 | 7,5 |
| **Saturday** | 1,4 | -0,4 - 3,5 | 2932 - 4320 | 6,6 |
| **Sunday** | 3,0 | 1,0 - 6,8 | 1222 - 3077 | 5,0 |
| **Monday** | 5,3 | 0,4 - 12,7 | 2257 - 3313 | 4,7 |

The start of the week will be very affordable. On **Tuesday**, the average price is expected to be 1,4 cents, and the range will stay within 0,5–2,2 cents. **Wednesday’s** level will dip to 0,6 cents and the lowest hourly price will turn negative (-0,2 ¢). **Thursday’s** average will be 1,2 ¢ with the day’s low at -0,7 ¢. Strong wind, mostly well above 3,000 MW and at times above 6,000 MW, will likely explain the low price level on these days.

The favorable trend would continue with **Friday’s** 1,6-cent and **Saturday’s** 1,4-cent averages. On Saturday, prices would briefly go negative (-0,4 ¢). The week’s cheapest periods will concentrate overnight and in the early morning, while afternoons and evenings will sit closer to the daily average.

On **Sunday**, the level will rise to 3,0 cents and the highest hour will reach 6,8 cents. Wind will be weak then (minimum 1 222 MW), which supports higher prices compared with the beginning of the week. The forecast includes a spike risk in the morning around 07:00–09:00, with the peak near 08:00.

The clearest exception will be **next Monday**. The day’s average is projected at 5,3 cents and the maximum at 12,7 cents. The spike will center on the evening around 17:00–19:00, with 18:00 as the midpoint. Other hours will stay well below this, but intraday variation will also be clear in the morning. Overall, the week will look affordable from Tuesday to Saturday, and from Sunday prices will move higher, culminating—after the early-week lows—in Monday’s evening spike.
