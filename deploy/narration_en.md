The upcoming week brings fluctuating electricity prices. **Monday** is expected to have relatively low prices, with an average of about 4.9 cents per kilowatt-hour. Wind power production remains fairly steady at the start of the week. **Tuesday** sees prices potentially rising to a peak of 18.4 cents, with a noticeably higher average price of 9.1 cents. This is due to low wind power production in the morning. There is also a high risk of price spikes on Tuesday, particularly in the morning and evening hours.

**Wednesday** has the highest anticipated prices, with an average reaching 10.5 cents and individual hours potentially hitting 22.8 cents. The risk of price spikes remains significant on Wednesday, as wind power is at its lowest in the morning. **Thursday** sees a slight decrease in prices from Wednesday, yet they remain relatively high, with continued risk of price spikes.

**Friday** is expected to have moderate prices, with the average at 7.7 cents. The risk of price spikes still exists. The weekend brings more stable price expectations. **Saturday** has an average price of 4.1 cents, and **Sunday** is forecasted to have the lowest prices of the week, with an average of 3.6 cents. On Sunday, wind power production is at its peak, supporting the lower prices.
