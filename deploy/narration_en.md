The week will be shaped by clear variation. **Friday** prices will rise towards the afternoon and early evening, with the day's high likely between 16:00–18:00 (16,7 ¢). For **Saturday**, it will be a public holiday, so demand may be lower than usual, but very low wind output (average 517 MW) will keep the spike risk for individual hours elevated; the highest hourly price would likely fall between 10:00–12:00 (15,1 ¢). **Thursday** stands out clearly: the average price would be 8,1 ¢ with a maximum of 23,7 ¢. The minimum wind output would drop to 519 MW, which explains the higher peak price; the top is most likely between 17:00–19:00.

The cheapest days would be seen on **Sunday**, **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, with average prices staying in the 1,0–1,8 ¢ range. Negative prices would occur in the early hours of Sunday around 03:00–05:00, on Tuesday late evening 21:00–23:00, and in the first hours of Wednesday night 00:00–02:00. On **Monday** the average price would be 3,7 ¢ with modest intraday variation. Strong winds on Sunday, Tuesday and Wednesday support the low price level, while weaker output on Thursday and Saturday increases intraday volatility.
