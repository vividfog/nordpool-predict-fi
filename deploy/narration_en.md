The first part of the week is expected to be inexpensive. **From Wednesday to Saturday**, averages will sit between 0,7 and 3,2 ¢, and intraday variation will stay within a few cents. Negative-price hours will appear overnight on Friday and Saturday; on Friday the lowest dip will be in the early night, and on Saturday around 02:00–07:00 for several hours. The low levels will be explained by abundant wind power, clearly above 3 000 MW on these days.

Later in the week the direction will change. **On Sunday** the average price will rise to 7,1 ¢, and spike risk for individual hours will be expected especially around 09:00–11:00. **On Monday** and **Tuesday** average prices will climb to costly levels, 9,7 and 10,2 ¢, and peaks will exceed 15 ¢ (Monday 16,1 ¢ at 17:00–19:00, Tuesday 16,6 ¢ at 09:00–11:00). Weak wind — the days’ minimum output will stay at 841–1 088 MW — will explain the increase.
