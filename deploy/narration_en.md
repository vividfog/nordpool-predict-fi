|:-------------|:----------------:|:----------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| **Friday** | 10,9 | 2,6 - 19,4 | 636 - 3926 | 5,9 |
| **Saturday** | 8,9 | 4,8 - 14,9 | 871 - 4227 | 5,2 |
| **Sunday** | 4,2 | 2,4 - 5,8 | 3171 - 5234 | 4,7 |
| **Monday** | 10,4 | 3,9 - 19,2 | 1140 - 3144 | 4,0 |
| **Tuesday** | 6,4 | 2,3 - 16,6 | 1337 - 3960 | 3,6 |
| **Wednesday** | 3,1 | 0,6 - 6,0 | 3634 - 5019 | 5,0 |
| **Thursday** | 7,9 | 3,5 - 13,5 | 1082 - 3039 | 6,3 |

The week will split in two. The lowest average prices will be seen on **Sunday** (avg 4,2 Â¢) and **Wednesday** (avg 3,1 Â¢), while **Fridayâ€™s** and next **Mondayâ€™s** averages will rise to 10,9 and 10,4 cents. The highest single-hour price is forecast on Friday at 19,4 Â¢, with Monday close at 19,2 Â¢.

**Fridayâ€™s** peak will land in the late morning, most likely 10â€“12. Spike risk will be elevated, supported by wind output dipping to just 636 MW at the daily minimum. On **Saturday** the risk of isolated highs will also be raised; morning prices will most likely firm around 8â€“10, with a projected maximum of 14,9 Â¢. The intraday swings will align with wind dips, as the minimum falls to 871 MW.

Price levels will ease on **Sunday**. Prices will mostly remain in the 2â€“5 cent range with limited variation. Strong wind output (above 3000 MW during the day, peaking at 5234 MW) will support the low level. On **Wednesday** the affordable picture will continue: during the night and early morning prices will drop to 0,6 cents, and the dayâ€™s upper bound will stay near 6 cents. High wind, with even the minimum at 3634 MW, will explain the low prices.

Next **Monday** the spike risk will shift to the evening, most likely 18â€“20, when the peak will reach 19,2 Â¢. Minimum wind will be below 2000 MW (1140 MW), which will explain the higher maximum. On **Tuesday** risks will cluster in the morning 8â€“10; the dayâ€™s top will be 16,6 Â¢ with a wind minimum of 1337 MW. On **Thursday** a similar risk will lean toward the evening 17â€“19, with peaks around 13,5 Â¢, partly because the wind minimum will be 1082 MW. These are forecasts, and realized prices may still shift if wind forecasts change.
