Electricity prices will vary significantly in the upcoming week, but overall they will remain at a reasonable level. **Friday** is expected to see considerable price fluctuations, with a maximum price potentially reaching 18.8 cents, making it the most expensive day of the week. This results from low wind power minimum production, which is projected to be 719 megawatts.

On **Saturday** and **Sunday**, lower average prices of 1.6 and 2.4 cents are anticipated. However, these days are expected to experience individual price spikes, particularly on Saturday, where prices could range from -0.5 cents to 7.2 cents. On Sunday, wind power production will average 778 megawatts, partly explaining the price variations.

During the middle of the week, from **Monday** to **Wednesday**, prices will remain moderate, ranging between 2.2 and 2.9 cents. No significant price spikes are expected on these days, and wind power production is relatively stable.

However, there is a possibility of individual price spikes on Wednesday, even though the average price is estimated to be 2.9 cents. This is due to variations in wind power production, which could affect the price.

**Thursday** sees a slight increase in price levels, with the average price projected at 4.3 cents. Wind power production is forecasted to be at its lowest at 770 megawatts, which could contribute to higher prices. Thursday is also predicted to have price spikes that may occur in the later hours of the day.
