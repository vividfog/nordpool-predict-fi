The electricity market is expected to see fluctuating prices in the upcoming week. On **Saturday** and **Monday**, the average electricity price is projected to be at 2.8 cents per kilowatt-hour. Both days are forecasted to have individual price spikes, especially in the evening, which could temporarily increase costs for consumers. On Sunday, the situation is calmer as prices are expected to decrease to an average of two cents, with no price spikes anticipated.

On **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, the price level continues to decline, with Tuesday's average price at 1.8 cents and Wednesday's at 1.3 cents per kilowatt-hour. Both days will benefit from higher average wind power, supporting lower prices. On Thursday, the lowest average price of the week is forecasted at just 0.4 cents per kilowatt-hour, due to strong wind power production.

At the end of the week, on **Friday**, prices will rise again slightly to 2.7 cents. Possible price spikes are also forecasted for Friday evening, which may impact consumers' electricity bills.
