During the upcoming week, the expectations for spot electricity prices show diverse fluctuations. **Monday** is expected to have moderate prices, ranging from 0.4 to 8.5 cents. From the start of the week, price levels remain reasonable, but on **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, individual price spikes are anticipated, especially on Tuesday morning from 8‚Äì10 a.m. and Wednesday morning from 8‚Äì10 a.m., when prices may exceed ten cents. On these days, wind power production is low, which may partly raise prices.

On **Thursday**, prices are expected to remain close to Tuesday and Wednesday levels, with risks again for price spikes, especially in the evening hours from 7‚Äì9 p.m. Electricity prices are expected to remain reasonable throughout the week, with **Friday** anticipated to offer slightly lower price levels, potentially making it the most affordable day of the week. On **Saturday** and **Sunday**, prices continue to decrease, with Sunday appearing to be the cheapest day of the week, with prices as low as 0.1 cents.

The week's weather forecast does not predict significant temperature fluctuations, which contributes to stable price development. Wind power production remains variable, which partly explains the price fluctuations on different days. Overall, the week offers reasonable electricity prices without significant surprises.
