|:-------------|:----------------:|:----------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| **Monday** | 10.5 | 4.5 - 16.0 | 776 - 2332 | -1.2 |
| **Tuesday** | 14.0 | 7.4 - 20.8 | 648 - 1477 | -1.2 |
| **Wednesday** | 15.5 | 9.8 - 23.0 | 1152 - 2007 | -2.6 |
| **Thursday** | 8.5 | 4.4 - 15.4 | 777 - 4612 | -2.3 |
| **Friday** | 2.2 | 1.1 - 4.9 | 3508 - 5694 | 1.9 |
| **Saturday** | 1.3 | 0.0 - 2.4 | 4485 - 5342 | 3.1 |
| **Sunday** | 4.2 | 1.6 - 7.1 | 2357 - 4033 | -0.8 |

The week will start on the expensive side. **Monday** the risk of price spikes will be elevated, and the peak would fall at 15:00–17:00 around 16.0 ¢. **Tuesday** peaks would land at 17:00–19:00 (up to 20.8 ¢), and **Wednesday** the highest hour would appear in the morning at 08:00–10:00 (up to 23.0 ¢). These surges would be explained by minimum wind output falling well below 2,000 MW on those days. **Thursday** individual higher hours would hit the morning at 07:00–09:00 (around 15.4 ¢), but the daily average will already ease.

Later in the week prices will decline clearly. **Friday** and **Saturday** will stay below four cents throughout the day, and on Saturday night at 02:00–04:00 the price would even touch zero. Strong winds later in the week would explain the low levels. The week will end with **Sunday**, whose average price will be 4.2 ¢ and intraday variation will remain moderate, clearly below the early-week levels.
