|:-------------|:----------------:|:----------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| **Sunday** | 0,1 | 0,0 - 0,3 | 3752 - 6352 | 7,3 |
| **Monday** | 3,5 | 0,1 - 6,6 | 2701 - 6587 | 6,5 |
| **Tuesday** | 15,8 | 5,9 - 30,7 | 595 - 2465 | 6,4 |
| **Wednesday** | 7,6 | 1,7 - 15,2 | 1293 - 3588 | 6,4 |
| **Thursday** | 2,2 | 0,8 - 3,9 | 3492 - 4452 | 7,5 |
| **Friday** | 4,8 | 1,9 - 9,8 | 2515 - 4184 | 5,9 |
| **Saturday** | 7,2 | 2,2 - 16,6 | 990 - 3689 | 5,2 |

The start of the week will be very inexpensive. In particular, **Sunday** will stay near zero, and strong wind output will support the low level. **Monday** will also average under four cents, so early in the week electricity will be priced clearly lower than midweek. Thursday will again remain inexpensive, pulling the week’s overall picture down.

A clear exception will be seen on **Tuesday**. The day’s average will rise to 15,8 ¢ and the maximum to 30,7 ¢. The risk of price spikes on individual hours will be elevated: the morning peak will most likely fall between 09:00–11:00 (highest forecast at 10:00), and in the evening between 18:00–20:00 (peak at 19:00). Wind power’s minimum output will sink very low, to 595 MW, which explains both the high maximum price and the sharp intraday swings.

On **Wednesday** as well, price spikes will be anticipated on individual hours. Based on the forecast, the morning rise will occur between 08:00–10:00, with the day’s highest hour at 09:00 (15,2 ¢). Wind levels will stay low throughout Wednesday, keeping prices clearly below Tuesday but still above the week’s most inexpensive days.

Toward the end of the week, on **Thursday** the average price will dip to around two cents as winds are plentiful. **Friday** will remain in the middle range without notable peaks. On **Saturday** the average will climb back to around seven cents, and the risk of individual spikes will stand out in the evening between 18:00–20:00 (highest hour at 19:00, 16,6 ¢). Saturday’s wind minimum will come close to one thousand megawatts, supporting the formation of the evening peak.
