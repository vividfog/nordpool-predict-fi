The week will start with a clearly pricier day: on **Wednesday** the average price is expected at 12,7 cents and the day’s peak at 18,9 cents. A spike in individual hours is anticipated in the morning; the sharpest peak would fall around 08–10. Already on **Thursday** the price level will calm, with the average easing to 6,9 cents.

The rest of the week will appear mostly inexpensive: **Friday’s** and **Saturday’s** averages are 4,4 ¢ and 3,2 ¢, Sunday 4,7 ¢. Next **Monday** will rise to 6,6 cents, but **Tuesday** returns to 3,9 cents. Sub‑four‑cent hours will occur especially in early Saturday morning (around 02–04) and on Tuesday night hours. Abundant wind power from Thursday onward (e.g., Thursday averages 6412 MW) will support a lower price level later in the week.
