| **Tuesday** | 7,1 | 3,0 - 10,8 | 2403 - 3463 | 0,6 |

| **Sunday** | 3,5 | 2,8 - 3,9 | 4021 - 5209 | -0,8 |

At the start of the week, prices will remain low. On **Sunday** and **Monday** the average price will settle at 3.5 cents, and many hours will stay below four cents. Strong wind generation will explain the level.

Midweek the price level will rise. **Tuesday** will average 7.1 ¢ and **Wednesday** 8.0 ¢, with intraday peaks around 10.8–11.7 cents. **Thursday** will level off to about 5.3 cents and **Friday** will average 4.9 ¢. **Saturday** will feature standout afternoon hours: the forecast’s highest hourly price, 12.7 ¢, will most likely fall around 15:00–17:00. Saturday’s minimum wind output will drop to 1 136 MW, clearly below 2 000 MW, and this explains the week’s highest maximum price. Otherwise, the week’s variation will appear moderate, and no especially cold weather will push demand higher.
