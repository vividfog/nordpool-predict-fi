Prices over the week are expected to vary. **Tuesday** is projected to see the average at 11,1 ¢ and the day’s peak reaching 20,4 ¢. Weak wind is expected to explain the difference: minimum wind output will drop to 936 MW, and this low level coincides with the day whose maximum price is the week’s highest. At the start of the week, **Monday** will remain lower at 6,5 ¢. **Thursday** is expected to be the cheapest day, with a 3,5 ¢ average and a narrow range of 1,6–5,5 ¢. On **Wednesday** the average is set around 5,4 ¢, and **Friday’s** 7,3 ¢ is expected to approach weekend levels.

The week’s lowest-cost hours are expected during **Thursday** night, around 03:00–05:00, when the price dips to 1,6 ¢. Spike risk will stand out on **Tuesday** during individual evening hours; the peak is expected around 17:00–19:00, and the realized level could exceptionally rise above the forecast. On **Sunday** there is also spike risk, most likely around 17:00–19:00, but the daily average will remain at 7,2 ¢. The weekend as a whole will look moderate, with prices mostly in the 3,0–13,0 ¢ range.
