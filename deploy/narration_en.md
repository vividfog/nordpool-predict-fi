The electricity price forecast for the coming week indicates substantial daily variations. The cheapest day will be **Monday**, when the average electricity price will remain below one cent per kilowatt-hour. Negative prices as low as -0.7 cents are anticipated during the early morning hours between 5 and 7 am. This is mainly due to strong wind power generation, which will peak at over 3700 megawatts during the day.

On **Tuesday**, prices will rise significantly. The day's expected average price is 4.6 ¬¢, but the highest rates will occur in the evening between 7 and 9 pm, when prices will exceed 13 cents. Tuesday will see a clear risk of individual price spikes precisely during evening hours, primarily due to wind power production dropping momentarily below 500 megawatts.

The most expensive day of the week will be **Wednesday**, with an average electricity price of 7.2 cents. Wednesday‚Äôs price peaks will occur in the morning between 8 and 10 am, when prices may rise up to 14 cents. The price increase on Wednesday is especially driven by very low wind power generation, at its lowest only 296 MW.

On **Thursday** and **Friday**, prices will decline again to more moderate levels. Thursday‚Äôs average price will be 4.7 cents, but prices will rise to 8.6 cents during the morning hours between 9 and 11 am. On Friday, prices will be even lower, with the average price below three cents. Early Friday morning between 4 and 5 am, minimal negative prices will again be observed.

During the weekend, electricity prices will climb once more. **Saturday‚Äôs** average price will be 5.1 cents, and the highest rates will occur in the evening between 7 and 9 pm, when prices will reach 11 cents. On Saturday, the average wind power generation will be low, explaining the higher prices and significantly increasing the risk of price spikes. On **Sunday**, prices will remain at Saturday's level, with average prices slightly below five cents and peak prices again climbing to 11 cents in the evening between 7 and 9 pm.

Throughout the week, price fluctuations will be significant, especially due to variations in wind power. Notable price spikes are expected particularly on Tuesday and Wednesday, when wind power generation is low and price increases could exceed forecasts.
