In the upcoming week, the electricity market will see fluctuations both in prices and wind power production. On **Thursday** and **Wednesday**, significant price spikes are expected, partly due to low wind power production. Thursday's average price will be 9.7 cents per kilowatt-hour, but individual hours may exceed 15 cents, leading to price spikes particularly around 8-10 AM and 6-8 PM. Wednesday presents a similar situation, with prices possibly rising over 18 cents, which may concern consumers during peak hours.

The most affordable prices of the week are forecasted for **Sunday**, with an average price of only 3.1 cents. Wind power production is also reasonable, supporting these low price levels. **Friday** and **Saturday** will also have low prices, providing consumers an opportunity to benefit from cheaper hours.

**Monday** sees a slight price increase, but they remain moderate. This could be due to decreased wind power production, predicted to be low, especially during the early morning hours. **Tuesday** once again offers cheaper prices, but Wednesday brings the possibility of new price spikes.

The week's price trends show clear differences between days, and consumers should particularly watch **Thursday** and **Wednesday** for potential price spikes. However, the weekend offers a respite with more affordable prices.
