In the coming week, electricity prices will vary significantly, with a notable risk of price spikes, especially on **Friday**, **Saturday**, and **Monday**. **Saturday** stands out with the highest average price of 14.9 ¬¢/kWh and a maximum price reaching up to 28.5 ¬¢. This is mainly due to the low wind power production, averaging only 767 MW. Extremely low wind power figures, such as those on Saturday and next **Monday**, significantly drive up prices, which may explain the high maximum prices.

On the other hand, **Thursday** is anticipated to be the least expensive day of the week, with an average price forecasted at 5.9 ¬¢/kWh thanks to a wide availability of wind power, ranging from 1842 MW to 3592 MW. Over the weekend, particularly on **Sunday**, prices are expected to be more moderate, though the risk of price spikes remains.

On **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, prices are expected to remain at a reasonable level, but the potential for high maximum prices persists, as wind power production is projected to remain low. Overall, the week's price fluctuations are largely due to variations in wind power production, highlighting its importance in the electricity pricing for the upcoming week.
