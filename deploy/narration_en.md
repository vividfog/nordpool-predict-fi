Electricity price forecasts for the coming days indicate substantial fluctuations. Prices will be higher at the start of the period, especially on **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, when the expected daily average price will reach 6.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. Both days will also experience certain hours when electricity prices exceed 13 cents. The risk of price spikes is significant these days, with peak prices occurring in the morning hours between approximately 8â€“10.

On **Friday**, electricity prices will drop noticeably compared to previous days. Although Friday's average price is slightly over four cents, the most expensive hours in the morning (7â€“9) will still remain above 10 cents. The risk of price spikes remains present, even though the day's overall price level is more moderate.

The clearly cheapest days of the week will be **Saturday** and **Sunday**, when average electricity prices fall below two cents per kilowatt-hour. On Saturday, negative prices will occur in the early morning hours, dropping as low as -0.5 cents between 4â€“5 am. Negative pricing continues slightly into early Sunday morning, with a minimum price of -0.1 cents between 2â€“3 am. On both weekend days, electricity prices remain moderate throughout the day, and significant fluctuations are not expected.

On **Monday**, prices will rise again from the weekend's low level to about four and a half cents, with individual hours potentially reaching close to nine cents. The risk of price spikes appears again, especially during evening hours between approximately 7â€“9 pm.

Next **Tuesday**, electricity prices will decrease slightly from Monday's level, with an average price of around 3.7 cents. Price variation will be less pronounced, and no significant price peaks are expected on Tuesday.
