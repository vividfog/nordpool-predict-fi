The weekly price curve will undulate. **Saturday** will post a moderate average price of 5,9 Â¢, with a range of 0,5â€“12,7 Â¢. **Sunday** will be even cheaper: the average is expected at 2,9 Â¢, with variation holding between 0,5â€“4,8 Â¢.

The weekâ€™s highest daily average will fall on **Monday** (10,5 Â¢). Weak wind (average 1934 MW) will support the higher level. Spike risk is anticipated for individual hours: the dayâ€™s peak is forecast in the 16â€“18 window (maximum 16,2 Â¢). Elevated prices will also appear in the late morning.

**Tuesday** will see volatility sharpen: the daily maximum is projected at 18,8 Â¢, with a 7,1 Â¢ average. The minimum wind output will drop very low (1372 MW), which clearly explains the highest peak price. The peak would fall in the 8â€“10 window. A wide intraday range will be seen, with prices rising in the morning hours and easing toward evening.

Wednesdayâ€™s price level will remain low. **Wednesday** is projected to average 2,2 Â¢, with intraday variation confined to 0,7â€“4,1 Â¢. Wind generation will be plentiful, which in part will keep prices down. **Sundayâ€™s** strong output likewise shows up as a consistently low price level.

In the latter half of the week, levels will return to mid-range. **Thursday** is estimated to average 6,3 Â¢, but there remains spike risk for individual hours; the highest levels will tilt toward the evening, around 18â€“20 (maximum 13,7 Â¢). **Fridayâ€™s** average will settle at 4,6 Â¢, though individual hours may tick up around the evening peak at 18â€“20 (daily maximum 6,8 Â¢). Overall, the cheapest moments will cluster in Sundayâ€™s and Wednesdayâ€™s night and morning hours, while the highest prices will appear in the early-week mornings and Mondayâ€™s early evening.
