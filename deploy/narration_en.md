The weekly price picture will be broadly moderate, and the weekend will look inexpensive. Because of public holidays, both **Wednesday**, **Thursday**, and **Friday** will, with lighter demand, remain on average low, around 3–6 cents. Wind power will be abundant especially on Thursday, which supports a low price level. **Saturday** will stand out as the cheapest of the week, with an average price of 1,9 ¢ and a range of 0,7–3,9 ¢. **Sunday** will continue near a three‑cent average.

Compared with the start of the week, **Monday** will settle slightly higher, around 3,9 ¢. The most expensive will be **Tuesday**, with an average rising to 8,0 ¢ and a daily high expected at 11,1 ¢. Tuesday’s higher prices will coincide with the week’s lower wind power levels. The day’s priciest hours will cluster in the evening around 17:00–19:00 and in the morning around 8:00–10:00, when prices will reach 10–11 cents. The cheapest hours will occur especially during weekend night and morning periods, when pricing will often stay clearly below three cents.
