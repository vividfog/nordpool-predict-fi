Average prices at the start of the period are expected to remain mostly in the 12–15¢ range, so the overall picture will be fairly expensive.

The highest single hourly price of the week is expected to occur on **Monday**, when the maximum reaches 23.0¢. Monday’s peak will fall between 16:00 and 18:00.

The risk of price spikes is expected to be elevated on **Saturday**, when the highest hourly price falls between 08:00 and 10:00, and wind output at the same time drops very low, to a minimum of 604 megawatts. A similar spike risk is expected on **Tuesday**, when the peak falls between 10:00 and 12:00, and on **Wednesday**, when the most expensive hours land between 17:00 and 19:00. Sub-zero temperatures are forecast every day, with the coldest average on Wednesday at -12.0°C.
