Next **Friday**, electricity price expectations are the highest of the week, with significant variability throughout the day. The maximum electricity price could rise to as much as 18.8 cents, which is notably high compared to other days of the week. **Friday's** high maximum price is coupled with low wind power production forecasts, especially in the evening, which may explain the price increase.

On **Saturday** and **Sunday**, significantly cheaper electricity is expected. The average prices on these days remain below three cents. However, price peaks are possible, especially during the morning and evening hours. Wind power production is weaker, which may partly explain these peaks.

Next **Monday** and **Tuesday**, electricity prices remain moderate, averaging below three cents. Wind power production is near normal levels on these days, and there is no significant risk of price peaks.

On **Wednesday**, electricity prices are expected to rise slightly, with an average price forecast of 4.2 cents. The maximum price, 9.6 cents, occurring in the evening, could result from variations in wind power production throughout the day. On **Thursday**, prices drop slightly from **Wednesday's** level, but price peaks are still possible.

The general overview of the week indicates significant variation in prices throughout the day, with **Friday's** high maximum price standing out. Wind power production remains mostly normal, but low production periods may temporarily raise prices.
