The weekend will look inexpensive. On Friday the price level will stay within the 0,1–2,2 ¢ range and the daily average will settle at 1,3 ¢. On Saturday prices are pushed even lower: the average is forecast at 0,4 ¢ and individual negative hourly prices will most likely occur overnight around 01:00–03:00. Strong wind power production over the weekend will support the low levels.

The week’s highest price level will occur at the start of the week. On Monday the average rises to 5,2 ¢ and the price peaks at 7,8 ¢ in the afternoon around 15:00–17:00. On Tuesday the level eases to 2,8 ¢. On Wednesday the average climbs again to 4,3 ¢ and the intraday high is 7,5 ¢ in the afternoon at 16:00–18:00. On Thursday prices remain elevated, with the average at 4,8 ¢ and the daily range at 3,0–6,6 ¢. The week’s cheapest moments will fall during Saturday night and morning hours, whereas the clearly most expensive period will be on Monday afternoon.
