The week’s clear high is expected on Friday afternoon. The daily average is projected at 10,3 ¢ with a peak of 20,9 ¢. The price peak would fall around 16:00–18:00. Wind output will be very low at its minimum, 345 MW, which would explain the elevated level. Prices would also be elevated in the late morning, around 09:00–11:00. Saturday is a public holiday, with the average holding near 5,2 ¢. However, a spike risk is forecast for individual hours, most likely in the morning around 08:00–10:00. On Saturday evening, prices are set to dip below zero at times, roughly 21:00–23:00.

Sunday’s average is projected at 1,2 ¢, and several negative hours are expected on Sunday morning. On Monday and Tuesday, prices will stay low (2,7 ¢ and 0,8 ¢), with periods near zero especially at night and early morning; brief negative periods are also expected on Tuesday. On Wednesday the level remains low (avg 0,7 ¢), and negative prices may occur overnight. From Sunday to Wednesday, wind power is expected to be abundant, broadly pushing prices down. Thursday’s average is 5,6 ¢, with a range of 0,7–11,1 ¢. Overall, the picture will be split: Friday forms the week’s most expensive period, whereas the weekend and early next week fall broadly below four cents.
