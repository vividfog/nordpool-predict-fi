*Next week, the electricity market prices will vary significantly, especially on Friday and Tuesday when wind power production is at its lowest. Sunday offers the most affordable prices of the week, with even negative prices possible.*  

The upcoming week's electricity market prices will vary significantly between the days. **Friday** stands out with the highest average price of 3.7 ¬¢/kWh, with potential price spikes, particularly in the morning at 8 am and evening at 8 pm. This is due to low wind power production, which might be as low as 198 MW. **Tuesday** might also surprise with high prices, as the average electricity price is forecasted to be 3.2 ¬¢/kWh, and the peak price could rise to 7.2 cents.

**Sunday** offers the most affordable electricity of the week, averaging 1.1 ¬¢/kWh, with even negative prices possible during the day. This is due to relatively good wind power availability, peaking at 1596 MW. **Thursday**, on the other hand, will see prices ranging between 0.4 and 2.9 cents, making it one of the week's most stable days in terms of price.

On **Saturday** and **Monday**, the electricity price forecast is moderate, but there is a risk of price spikes on both days. Saturday's price could rise in the morning at 9 am and in the evening at 7 pm. On Monday, high prices might occur during the morning and evening hours.

On **Wednesday**, prices are expected to remain moderate, with an average price of 2.8 ¬¢/kWh. However, electricity prices could rise in the afternoon when wind power production is at its lowest.
