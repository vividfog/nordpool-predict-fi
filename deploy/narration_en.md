Olkiluoto 2 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing a maintenance outage. The maintenance started on 25 May 2025 at 18:00 and is expected to end on 24 June 2025 at 09:00. This maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of price forecasts, as training data during outages is limited.

In the upcoming week, electricity exchange prices will vary considerably from one day to another. The cheapest day of the week will be **Sunday**, when the average electricity price will remain very low, at only 0.1 cents. Sunday will also see the week's lowest single hourly price, dipping slightly below zero cents (negative one cent) in the early hours between 2–3 am. These low prices are partly due to relatively abundant wind power production.

The most significant price increase of the week will occur on **Thursday**, when the average price of electricity will rise to 6.8 cents. On Thursday, electricity prices will be particularly influenced by low wind power production, dropping below 500 MW at 8 am. Consequently, Thursday carries a high risk of price spikes. The highest hourly price, as high as 14 cents, is expected Thursday evening between 8–10 pm.

Prices will also rise slightly on **Friday**, with an average around three cents. Price fluctuations will be notable throughout Friday: at the lowest point, electricity will cost only 0.2 cents in the early hours, but by evening, between 8–9 pm, prices will approach nine cents. There is also a risk of price spikes on Friday during individual hours.

On **Saturday**, the average price will settle at around two cents, slightly above the week's overall average. Saturday will also carry a risk of price spikes, with the highest price reaching nearly five cents right after midnight.

During the early and middle part of the week, on **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, prices will remain relatively moderate, averaging around one to one-and-a-half cents. On Wednesday evening between 8–9 pm, prices will peak slightly above four cents, but otherwise these days will be stable in terms of price.

At the beginning of next week, on **Monday**, prices will again be moderate with an average around two cents. However, Monday will see some variation between hourly prices, with the lowest slightly negative and the highest exceeding five cents in the evening between 8–9 pm.
