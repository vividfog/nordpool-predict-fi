The week will start with the clearly lowest average price. **Monday’s** average will be 8.9 cents, and the cheapest moments will dip below four cents in the evening. After that, average prices will rise quickly. **Thursday** will likely see the week’s highest level, with the average reaching 20.2 cents and the day’s maximum climbing to 28.2 cents.

A cold spell will support the price level throughout the week, as every day’s average temperature will remain below −8°C. Thursday’s high prices will also be explained by very weak wind power, averaging 1248 MW and dipping as low as 854 MW during the day. The risk of price spikes is flagged for **Tuesday**, **Wednesday**, **Thursday**, **Friday**, **Saturday**, and **Sunday**. In the hourly forecast, the most expensive periods will fall especially on **Tuesday** between 17:00–19:00 and on **Thursday** between 09:00–11:00.
