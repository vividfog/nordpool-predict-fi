In the electricity price forecast for the coming days, price variations between different days will be notable. Daily average prices will range from Sunday's extremely affordable 0.3 cents to Friday's significantly higher 8.8 cents per kilowatt-hour. Particularly, **Friday** stands out with higher prices, featuring exceptionally high price spikes during the day. On Friday at around 7 p.m., electricity prices will rise above 18 cents, and prices from 6 to 8 p.m. also will remain notably high, exceeding 15 cents.

On **Thursday**, the average price expectation will settle slightly above five cents, but a high spike of almost 17 cents will occur between 10 and 11 p.m. On Saturday, prices will be more moderate, with the daily average remaining below four cents. The week's lowest momentary prices will occur during the weekend: on **Saturday** between 3 and 4 p.m., electricity prices will drop close to zero, and on **Sunday** during early morning hours as well as in the afternoon, prices will even turn negative. Thus, Sunday's expectations are exceptionally low, with a daily average price of merely 0.3 cents per kilowatt-hour.

The beginning of next week will be affordable. **Monday** and **Tuesday** average prices will remain below two cents, and both days will momentarily see negative prices as well. On **Wednesday**, prices will slightly increase, but still remain moderate, with an average price below three cents.

Wind power production varies significantly across days, affecting price differences. On Friday, wind power production will remain very low, explaining the high price spikes. Thursday’s high evening price spike also coincides with a period of low wind power production. During the weekend and early next week, wind power production will be considerably stronger, partly explaining the lower prices.

Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant currently experiences a production shortfall, which started on 23 June 2025 at 06:00 and is expected to end on 26 June 2025 at 01:00. The plant's current availability is 66.2 percent, with an available capacity of 1060 MW. This production shortfall may affect forecast accuracy, as training data for comparable situations is limited.
