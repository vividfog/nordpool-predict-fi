In the coming week, the electricity market will experience diverse fluctuations. **Monday** and **Wednesday** stand out with fairly similar price forecasts, with an average price of 2.4 ¢/kWh. Both days reach a maximum price of 7.4 cents, potentially leading to price spikes, especially during the morning and evening peak hours. **Tuesday**, on the other hand, offers the most affordable electricity prices of the week, at just 0.4 ¢/kWh, due to abundant wind power production exceeding 4500 MW.

**Thursday** and **Friday** are also expected to have moderate prices, but Friday's average price rises slightly higher to 4.4 ¢/kWh. This might be due to low wind power production, dropping below 1000 MW during some hours. **Friday's** maximum price climbs to 8.9 cents, which may impact consumer price sensitivity.

Over the weekend, **Saturday** and **Sunday** see forecasts dropping again, with Sunday particularly notable for its low average price of just 0.1 ¢/kWh. Negative prices are also predicted for several hours on Sunday, which may entice consumers to take advantage of cheap electricity.
