Electricity prices on the market will vary significantly next week. **Monday** stands out with its high prices, as the day's average price rises to 12.2 cents and the maximum price reaches 26.3 ¢. This may be due to low wind power production, which averages only 502 MW. **Sunday** also appears expensive, with an average price of 10.4 ¢ and a maximum price of 20.8 ¢. On these days, there is a high risk of price spikes, particularly during the morning and evening hours.

The most affordable prices of the week will be seen on Friday, with an average price of just 3.3 cents and a maximum price remaining modest at 5.8 cents. **Friday's** low prices are partly explained by high wind power production, averaging 2268 MW. **Saturday** also offers more affordable prices, with an average price of 6.4 ¢.

**Tuesday** stands out with its high wind power production, keeping prices moderate, although the average price rises to 6.2 cents. However, there is a risk of price spikes, as the maximum price could reach 13.7 ¢. **Wednesday** is similar, with an average price of 7.0 ¢ and a maximum price of 12.6 ¢. Thursday and Friday, on the other hand, offer stable and affordable prices without significant price spikes.
