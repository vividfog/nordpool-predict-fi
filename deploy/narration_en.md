The week will look inexpensive based on the forecast. On most days, the average price will stay under four cents. The lowest averages are expected for Wednesday, 0,6 Â¢, and Thursday, 1,8 Â¢. The most expensive day will stand out as Monday with an average of 6,9 Â¢, and the weekâ€™s highest hourly price will be 11,3 Â¢. Negative prices are anticipated for Wednesdayâ€™s and Thursdayâ€™s night and morning hours (minimums -0,4 Â¢ and -0,5 Â¢).

**Monday** will bring clear variation in prices. The late-morning peak will fall between 09:00â€“11:00 and reach 11,3 Â¢. Another rise will appear in the evening between 17:00â€“19:00, when the level will approach about 10 cents. The dayâ€™s lowest wind output will drop to 1974 megawatts, which is below 2000 MW. This will partly explain why Mondayâ€™s maximum price will be the weekâ€™s highest.

**Friday** will see an average of 3,2 cents, but individual hours will carry a spike risk. The evening peak will fall between 18:00â€“20:00 and climb to 10,4 Â¢. The minimum wind output will occur the same evening (1841 MW), which supports the higher prices within the day.

**Tuesday** will remain low and fairly even: average 2,8 Â¢ and a range of 0,1â€“8,7 Â¢. **Wednesday** and **Thursday** will feature the weekâ€™s negative prices, focused on night and morning; the daysâ€™ averages will be 0,6 and 1,8 Â¢. **Saturday** will have a narrow range (1,3â€“3,9 Â¢) and an average of 2,5 Â¢. **Sunday** will stay moderate, average 1,4 Â¢ and a minimum of 0,2 Â¢.

The lowest prices will cluster, according to the forecast, in the early hours of Wednesday and Thursday. The highest periods will fall in Mondayâ€™s 09:00â€“11:00 and Fridayâ€™s 18:00â€“20:00 windows. The overall picture for the week will remain very low, and everyday consumption can, based on the forecast, be scheduled widely into sub-four-cent hours.
