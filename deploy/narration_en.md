The week’s price development will appear variable. On Sunday, an exceptionally low level is expected: average price 2.8 ¢ and a range of 0.9–4.6 ¢; abundant wind generation will likely push prices down. On Tuesday the level will rise clearly, with an average of 13.1 ¢ and a high of 22.4 ¢. The minimum wind output will drop exceptionally low (298 MW), which explains the higher maximum price. The risk of price spikes will stand out, and peak hours will likely fall around 16:00–18:00.

The other days will settle closer to the middle range. On Monday the average price will be 7.0 ¢ (3.1–11.0 ¢). On Wednesday 5.7 ¢ and on Thursday 5.0 ¢ will remain moderate. Friday’s average will be 7.9 ¢, but individual hours are forecast to carry spike risk: the highest hourly price of 16.7 ¢ will most likely land at 18:00–20:00. On Saturday the average will be 7.2 ¢ and the day’s high 12.7 ¢.
