Next week, electricity prices are expected to vary significantly based on the day and time. **Monday** and **Tuesday** will have low average prices, staying below two cents. On **Monday**, strong wind power production partly explains the low prices. **Tuesday** will see even negative prices during the night hours, which is rare.

**Wednesday** and **Thursday** stand out with higher average prices, especially **Thursday**, when there is a risk of price spikes during certain hours. The maximum price on Thursday could reach nearly ten cents, possibly due to low wind power production, which drops below 2000 MW.

**Friday** and **Saturday** will return to more affordable price levels, and on **Saturday**, negative prices will appear again during the night hours. **Sunday** is expected to have the highest maximum price of the week, rising to 13.9 cents in the evening when wind power production is lower.

Overall, the upcoming week offers intriguing price variations, and particularly the negative prices may encourage electricity users to time their consumption during the most affordable hours.
