Electricity prices in the coming week will remain mostly affordable. However, clear differences between days will be observed, both in average prices and price fluctuations. Early in the week, particularly **Tuesday** and **Monday**, price expectations will be higher, with maximum prices potentially exceeding 10 cents.

The cheapest day of the week will be **Sunday**, when the average price is expected to remain around 1.6 cents. Sunday night will also feature the week's lowest hourly price, reaching exactly zero cents at 01:00. Throughout Sunday, electricity prices will remain very low, with no significant increases expected.

At the very beginning of the week, on **Monday**, prices will clearly rise compared to the previous day. Monday’s prices will range between 2.3 and 10.0 cents, with an average price around 4.8 cents. The highest prices on Monday will occur in the evening hours between 19:00–21:00, exceeding 9 cents according to the forecast. The risk of price peaks has been indicated for Monday, meaning individual hourly prices could rise higher than forecasted.

On **Tuesday**, the price level will remain relatively high. Tuesday’s average price of 5.8 cents will be the highest of the week. Price variation during the day will be significant, and the highest hourly price (10.5 ¢) will occur in the morning between 08:00–10:00. The risk of price peaks has also been noted for Tuesday, meaning peak prices could exceed the current forecast.

During the latter part of the week, prices will stabilize. On **Thursday** and **Friday**, average prices will remain below four cents, and on **Saturday**, the price will further drop to around two cents. Early Saturday morning at 03:00, electricity prices will approach zero, at only 0.2 cents.

Overall, the week will offer affordable hours especially during the weekend and nighttime, while the highest prices will concentrate in the early week and daytime as well as evening hours. Price variations will be evident, but extremely high price levels are not expected.
