During the coming week, electricity prices are expected to vary, largely following fluctuations in wind power production. **On Friday**, electricity prices are forecasted to range from slightly negative values up to 5.9 cents. The ample supply of wind power, averaging over 4200 MW, keeps prices low. **On Saturday** and **Sunday**, prices remain moderate, averaging 1.4 cents, with relatively small price fluctuations. Significant wind power production is forecasted for these days, supporting low electricity prices.

**Monday** brings noticeably higher prices, with an average of 5.0 cents, partly due to lower wind power production averaging around 2400 MW. **On Tuesday**, prices are expected to drop again, with an average price of about 2.5 cents, corresponding to an increase in wind power production. **On Wednesday**, prices are expected to rise again slightly, with variations in wind power production potentially causing price spikes, especially during morning and evening hours.

The most expensive day of the week is **Thursday**, with a forecasted average price of 6.2 cents and a maximum price reaching up to 10.8 cents. Wind power production is expected to be at a low level, partially explaining the higher prices. Therefore, consumers should be prepared for potential price spikes, especially during the day.
