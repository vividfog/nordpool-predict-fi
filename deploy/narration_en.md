The upcoming week appears to offer varied price developments in the electricity market. **Thursday** stands out as the most expensive day of the week, with the average price rising to 16.3 cents per kilowatt-hour. The maximum price also climbs to 33.2 cents, which may indicate individual price spikes, especially during evening hours when wind power production is at its lowest.

**Friday's** price development is more moderate, but it's important to note potential price spikes during the day, as forecasts point to a high maximum price. Saturday, on the other hand, offers the cheapest prices of the week, with the average price remaining below four cents. This is partly due to strong wind power, which is significantly higher than on other days.

**Sunday** continues to be relatively affordable, but the risk of price spikes remains, albeit lower than on Friday. **Monday** and **Tuesday** maintain reasonable price levels, with the possibility of price spikes on both days, which should be considered especially during morning and evening hours. **Wednesday** sees a slight rise in prices again, with the risk of individual high maximum prices when wind power production is low.
