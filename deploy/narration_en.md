During the upcoming week, electricity prices will fluctuate considerably. Early in the week, prices will remain relatively elevated, but towards the weekend price levels will drop noticeably.

The week's highest peak price will occur on **Tuesday**, with the maximum price expected to reach 11 cents in the morning between 8 and 10 a.m. The same day, wind power production will be at a very low level, dipping down to just 175 MW. Low wind power production explains this morning’s high peak price.

There is also a risk of price spikes on **Monday** and **Wednesday**, particularly during morning and early evening hours. On Monday evening between approximately 6 and 8 p.m., prices will rise above nine cents. Similarly, Wednesday morning from 7 to 9 a.m., prices exceeding eight cents are expected.

Towards the end of the week, prices will fall significantly. By **Friday**, the average price will have dropped to slightly above three cents, and the week's least expensive day will be **Saturday**, when the average price will be below two cents. Saturday will be clearly the cheapest day of the week, with the minimum price approaching zero (0,2 ¢). No risk of price spikes is forecasted for Saturday.

On **Sunday**, even negative electricity prices will occur briefly in the afternoon between 2 and 4 p.m., reaching momentarily to -0,1 cents. Such negative prices are uncommon and usually related to temporary oversupply or low demand.

Overall, the coming week will offer varying electricity pricing situations, so electricity users should monitor price developments especially early in the week and take advantage of the weekend’s lower-priced hours.
