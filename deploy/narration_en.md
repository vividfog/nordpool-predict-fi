*Next week's electricity market price trends will be variable, starting with low prices and culminating in strong increases on Friday. Electricity production is supported by fluctuating wind power, but individual price peaks may raise costs as the weekend approaches.*

Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance, which began on September 20, 2025, and is expected to end on October 10, 2025. Loviisa 1 plant is also under maintenance starting September 6, 2025, with an expected end date of September 29, 2025. These maintenance outages may affect the forecast's accuracy, as training data for outage periods is limited.

The upcoming week begins with relatively low electricity market prices on **Sunday** and **Monday**, with prices fluctuating around two cents. Both days benefit from strong wind power production, which helps keep electricity prices low. **Tuesday** sees a slight increase in prices, but they remain moderate.

On **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, prices rise, especially on Thursday afternoon when prices may reach 14.4 ¬¢/kWh. This could be due to decreased wind power production during the day. **Friday** sees prices clearly exceeding ten cents, with the risk of individual price spikes, particularly in the late morning around 9-11 AM.

During the weekend on **Saturday**, prices remain high, with the highest risk of price spikes in the morning and early evening. When looking at the week's overall picture, Friday stands out as the most expensive day, but the entire week's price expectations remain relatively variable due to fluctuations in wind and nuclear power production.
