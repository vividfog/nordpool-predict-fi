Price expectations for the coming days will remain mostly under five cents, so the week will appear generally inexpensive. Strong wind generation will depress the price level especially on **Thursday** and **Saturday**. In addition, both **Thursday** and **Friday** will be holidays, which is expected to reduce consumption and support low prices. During Friday night, around 01:00–03:00, the price would dip below zero, down to -0,5 ¢.

The price level will rise toward the start of next week. **Tuesday’s** average price will reach 4,5 ¢, and **Wednesday** will form the week’s most expensive day at a 4,9 ¢ average. On Wednesday evening, around 18:00–20:00, the intraday peak would climb to 9,4 ¢. The week’s lowest daily averages will be seen on Thursday (0,1 ¢) and Saturday (1,4 ¢), and the weekend will remain steadily moderate.
