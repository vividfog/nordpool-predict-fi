Price development will lean higher at the start of the week. **Wednesday** is expected to average 13,9 ¢ with a maximum of 22,9 ¢. Intraday swings will be tied to very weak wind (min 343 MW), which coincides with the highest peak price. The risk of price spikes will be notable around 08–10 and 16–18. **Thursday’s** average is projected at 8,0 ¢, but single-hour spike risk will stand out in the morning, most likely 07–09. **Friday’s** average is 8,6 ¢; peaks could hit the afternoon and early evening, roughly 15–17 and 17–19.

The weekend and early week will look inexpensive. **Saturday** will be a public holiday, and the average is seen at 2,8 ¢; a few highlighted hours may still appear around midday, about 10–12. **Sunday’s** average is expected at 1,0 ¢, with even a negative hour at night, around 02–04. **Monday** and **Tuesday** will remain low at 2,5 ¢ and 1,3 ¢. The cheap stretch will be explained by strong winds from Sunday onward (on average over 3,000 MW).
