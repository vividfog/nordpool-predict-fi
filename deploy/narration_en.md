Electricity price trends for the upcoming week appear variable. **Monday** is expected to have the week's highest average price at 13.6 ¢/kWh, with prices potentially rising to as much as 31.8 ¢/kWh during the day. This is partly due to low wind power production during the morning and evening, significantly increasing prices.

On **Tuesday**, price trends are similar to Monday, with an average price of 13.6 ¢/kWh. Price spikes are expected on Tuesday, particularly during morning and evening hours, where prices could reach up to 24.7 ¢/kWh. Wind power production is higher than on Monday, but during individual hours low production combined with high demand may increase prices.

**Wednesday** and **Thursday** see a significant drop in price expectations. Wednesday's average price is 5.3 ¢/kWh, and Thursday's is even lower at 4.6 ¢/kWh. Wind power production is strong on Wednesday, which pushes prices down. On Thursday, wind power production remains sufficient, explaining the more affordable price levels.

On **Friday** and **Saturday**, prices remain economical, with average prices at 2.9 and 2.6 ¢/kWh, respectively. While there is a risk of individual price spikes on Friday, they do not appear to be significant. In the weekend's price trends, **Sunday** is the most affordable day, with an average price of just 1.9 ¢/kWh. Sunday's low prices are due to high wind power production.

Although prices are higher at the beginning of the week, they significantly decrease as the week progresses, providing relief to electricity consumers. *Analysis by gpt-4o.* 🌬️
