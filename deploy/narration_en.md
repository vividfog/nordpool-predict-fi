Electricity prices will vary notably over the coming week. The lowest prices will occur during the weekend, whereas the highest price levels are expected on **Thursday**.

Compared to the beginning of the week, **Thursday** will have a significantly higher average price at 6,7 cents per kilowatt-hour. Price fluctuations during the day will be large; prices will drop below three cents at night, but between 08:00‚Äì10:00 in the morning, prices will rise above 13 cents. Additionally, there is a clear risk of individual price spikes on Thursday.

Prices will clearly decrease on **Friday**, when the daily average will remain below four cents. The cheapest hours of the week will be during the weekend, with negative hourly prices appearing on both **Saturday** and **Sunday**. During the early hours of Saturday, between 04:00‚Äì05:00, the price will slightly dip below zero, at -0,2 cents. Early Sunday morning, between 01:00‚Äì02:00, the price will fall even further, down to -0,7 cents.

After the weekend, prices will rise moderately next week. **Monday** will see an average price rise to 4,9 cents, **Tuesday** to 4,7 cents, and **Wednesday** to 5,5 cents. The price level, however, will remain affordable, with no single price spikes expected.

Wind power production will remain low throughout the week. Average production will be below 2500 megawatts each day, which may slightly increase prices. Particularly on Thursday, the minimum wind power production is very low, at only 276 megawatts, partly explaining the day's high maximum price. On other days, wind production will be slightly higher, but still low.
