*Prices will be very low from Sunday to Wednesday, but spike risk is expected on Friday and Thursday evenings; Saturday’s holiday tempers demand and lowers the average price.*

Price expectations will split in two. Individual hours over the weekend and late next week will rise clearly higher, whereas from Sunday to Wednesday average prices will stay close to one–two cents. Negative hours are forecast for Sunday, Tuesday and Wednesday night and early-morning hours. Saturday will be a public holiday, which may depress demand and the average level, although individual morning hours may rise.

The clearest spike risks will be seen on Friday evening and in Thursday’s evening peaks. Friday’s maximum is forecast at 18,7 ¢, with the peak falling around 17:00–19:00. Thursday stands out with the week’s highest maximum, 24,3 ¢, likewise in the evening at 17:00–19:00. Saturday’s morning peaks would land around 08:00–10:00, up to 14,1 ¢. These are accentuated by the fact that on these days the minimum wind power output will remain well below 2,000 MW, which explains the higher peak levels. As a counterweight, the strong wind from Sunday through Wednesday (over 3,000 MW on average) will support low prices around the clock.
