*Clear fluctuations are expected in electricity exchange prices during the coming week: the week begins very affordably, but prices will rise noticeably on Wednesday due to weak wind power production, and single-hour price spikes are anticipated on several days, particularly during morning and evening hours.*

During the coming week, the average electricity prices on the market will generally remain affordable, but there will be notable variations from day to day. The week begins very cheaply on **Monday**, with an average daily price of only 0.3 cents. Night-time hours will even see negative pricing, and the maximum price during the day will be just slightly above one cent.

On **Tuesday**, the price outlook rises clearly: the daily average climbs to 4.7 cents, and significant fluctuations will occur throughout the day. At its lowest during the night, electricity will be nearly free, but between 7-9 pm the price could rise close to 15 cents. Due to this, the risk of price spikes is high during Tuesday evening hours.

The highest average price will appear on **Wednesday**, reaching 7.4 cents. The higher price level can be attributed particularly to weak wind power production, averaging only 691 MW throughout the day. The day's highest price peak will occur in the morning between 8-10 am, when prices may exceed 13 cents. The risk of price spikes is also evident on Wednesday.

The price level will decrease slightly on **Thursday**, with an expected average price of 5.7 cents. Although the price is more moderate than on Wednesday, prices exceeding 10 cents will still occur in the morning hours between 8-10 am. Wind power production remains relatively low on Thursday, partially explaining the higher morning prices.

On **Friday**, the average electricity price will drop again considerably, remaining at a very low level of 1.7 cents. Prices during the day will be steady and low, with no price spikes expected.

Over the weekend, particularly on **Saturday**, prices will rise moderately. Saturday's average price will be 4.7 cents, and the day's price peak will occur in the evening between 7-9 pm, exceeding 9 cents. Sunday prices will remain somewhat steadier, with an average settling slightly above four cents. However, both days still carry the risk of individual price spikes.
