Electricity prices will remain affordable for most of the week, with daily averages generally below four cents per kilowatt-hour. The weekend's **Saturday** and **Sunday** are especially inexpensive, featuring average prices slightly above one cent. Both days will also experience negative prices during the night, when electricity rates are expected to drop below zero.

On **Monday**, the week's highest hourly price will occur in the evening between 19:00 and 21:00, exceeding 11 cents per kilowatt-hour. This price spike is linked to low wind power production, with output dropping slightly above one thousand megawatts. On other days, peak prices will remain moderate, although individual hours on **Wednesday** and **Thursday** may approach nine cents.

Wind power production will vary considerably throughout the week. **Tuesday** will be particularly windy, with production occasionally surpassing four thousand megawatts, partly explaining Tuesday's low average price of two and a half cents. Conversely, **Friday** will see the week's weakest wind power generation, averaging just over 1200 megawatts, potentially causing moderate price increases during certain hours.

Weekend nights will be exceptionally favorable for electricity users. Between Saturday and Sunday night, electricity prices will drop as low as -0.6 cents, meaning producers effectively pay for consumption. Sunday's favorable price levels will continue throughout the day, though prices will slightly rise in the evening.

Overall, the week will be economically favorable for electricity consumers, despite considerable daily fluctuations. In particular, the weekend will offer opportunities to benefit from exceptionally low prices.
