The week’s price picture will fluctuate. **On Friday**, the average price will rise to 12,0 cents and the day’s high to 21,9 ¢. Weak wind and an exceptionally low minimum output, 671 MW, will explain this. The spike risk will center on the evening, roughly 17:00–19:00. **On Saturday**, it will be a public holiday, which typically lightens demand; the average price will stay at 5,5 ¢, although briefly higher prices may occur in the morning around 08:00–10:00. **On Sunday**, prices will remain moderate, with an average of 5,2 ¢.

At the start of the week, the price level will tighten. **On Monday**, the average will be 8,8 ¢ and a single peak may land around 16:00–18:00. **On Tuesday**, the maximum is forecast at 18,9 ¢ in the morning hours (08:00–10:00); behind this is a very low wind power minimum of 965 MW. **On Wednesday**, elevated peaks will still be seen, up to 16,6 ¢, most likely 16:00–18:00. The cheapest days of the week will be Saturday and Sunday, whereas the clearest top-priced day will be Friday.
