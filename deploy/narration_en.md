The week will start at a higher price level before a clear decline toward the weekend. **Tuesday** will stand out with both the highest average price and the week’s top peak, 22,9 ¢. Behind this is an exceptionally low wind-power minimum (250 MW), which would explain the higher maximum. **Sunday** will be the cheapest: the day will average 3,6 ¢ and peaks will stay at 5,2 ¢. Abundant wind power (average 4617 MW) will push prices down.

Peaks on individual hours will concentrate on weekday mornings and evenings. **On Monday**, elevated levels would fall around 08:00–10:00. **On Tuesday**, the peak will likely occur around 18:00–20:00, with tight pricing also at 16:00–18:00. **On Wednesday**, the 16:00–18:00 window will stand out. **On Thursday**, the spike would fall around 17:00–19:00. **On Friday**, elevated levels will appear around 17:00–19:00. **On Saturday**, a possible high would occur around 08:00–10:00. **Sunday** is expected to be even and inexpensive without notable upticks.
