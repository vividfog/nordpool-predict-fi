Prices are expected to stay low at the start of the weekend: on **Saturday** the average is 3,3 ¢ with a 1,5–4,9 ¢ range. On **Sunday** the level will rise to 7,0 ¢, and individual spikes could appear in the early evening around 17:00–19:00, peaking at 14,1 ¢. Saturday’s affordability will be explained by abundant wind generation (4116–5628 MW).

On weekdays the averages will move into the expensive range: **Monday** 9,3 ¢, **Tuesday** 12,1 ¢, **Wednesday** 12,7 ¢, **Thursday** 10,1 ¢ and **Friday** 13,4 ¢. A high risk of spikes will be present on each of these days. A morning spike is expected on Monday at 08:00–10:00 (peak 18,0 ¢) and on Wednesday at 08:00–10:00 (20,4 ¢, the week’s highest). Evening-leaning spikes would likely hit Tuesday at 17:00–19:00 (18,2 ¢), Thursday at 16:00–18:00 (16,6 ¢) and Friday at 16:00–18:00 (19,8 ¢). Wednesday’s exceptional peak will be linked to a very low wind minimum, near 1000 MW. Weak winds through the weekdays (often below 2500 MW) will keep average prices elevated. Values may still shift if the wind forecast changes.
