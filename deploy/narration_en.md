|:-------------|:----------------:|:----------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| **Thursday**   | 15,7 | 10,6 - 22,0 | 1246 - 1829 | -3,2 |
| **Friday** | 16,2 | 8,0 - 26,2  | 484 - 1647  | -3,2 |
| **Saturday**  | 7,5  | 5,7 - 10,6  | 1351 - 3567 | -1,7 |
| **Sunday** | 4,9  | 2,2 - 9,2   | 1825 - 5325 | -0,8 |
| **Monday** | 9,2  | 5,0 - 12,5  | 2190 - 3055 | -1,2 |
| **Tuesday**   | 14,6 | 7,7 - 23,5  | 646 - 2484  | -1,2 |
| **Wednesday**| 17,9 | 10,6 - 27,8 | 694 - 1711  | -2,6 |

Price levels over the week will vary markedly. **Sunday** is set to be the most affordable day, with an average of 4,9 ¢ and a range of 2,2–9,2 ¢. This is underpinned by exceptionally strong wind output. At the other end, **Wednesday** stands out with the highest weekly average, 17,9 ¢, and the highest maximum, 27,8 ¢. **Friday** (avg 16,2 ¢, max 26,2 ¢) and **Tuesday** (avg 14,6 ¢, max 23,5 ¢) will also be elevated. A common factor on these days is a very low minimum wind production, clearly below 2,000 MW, which explains the higher peaks.

The risk of price spikes will concentrate in selected windows. **Friday’s** peak will lean to the evening, roughly 17:00–19:00. **Saturday** could see a single spike around midnight between Friday and Saturday, about 23:00–01:00. **Tuesday** will likely peak in the early evening, 16:00–18:00. **Wednesday** looks to hit the evening high, around 17:00–19:00.
