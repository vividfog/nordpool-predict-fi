Price development will appear split in two. From Wednesday to Saturday, average prices will stay below five cents, and on Wednesday the average will be just 0,6 ¢ (minimum -0,7 ¢). On Thursday the minimum will also dip slightly below zero. This stretch will be assessed as moderate, as indicated by occasionally strong wind. Sunday is a public holiday, which may ease demand and keep the average around 2,4 ¢.

From the end of the week into the start of next week, the level will rise. Friday’s average will be 4,8 ¢, but single-hour spike risk is forecast especially in the morning at 7–9. Next Monday the average will climb to 8,8 ¢, and the highest level will fall in the evening hours 17–19 (daily maximum 16,3 ¢). Next Tuesday will stand out as the most expensive of the week: the average will be 12,6 ¢ and the maximum is estimated at 21,2 ¢. Wind will be exceptionally weak then (minimum 725 MW), which explains the high peak. Tuesday’s peaks are expected both in the morning at 8–10 and in the afternoon at 16–18.
