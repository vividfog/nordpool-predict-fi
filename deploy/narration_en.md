Next week's electricity price forecast appears varied. The weekend will begin with very affordable rates. On **Saturday**, the average price will remain below one cent (0.7 Â¢), and nighttime hours will even drop below half a cent. On **Sunday**, the weekâ€™s only negative pricing hour will occur at 1 a.m., slightly below zero. Sunday's average price will remain reasonable, although individual price spikes might appear in the evening between 18:00â€“20:00, when the rate rises close to four cents.

At the beginning of the new week, prices will clearly rise from weekend levels. On **Monday**, the highest average price of the week (4.9 Â¢) will be observed. Between 9:00â€“11:00, the price will reach above seven cents, representing the weekâ€™s second-highest peak price. On **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, prices will remain relatively high, around five cents. On **Wednesday**, the highest individual hourly price of the week (9.3 Â¢) is expected between 8:00â€“10:00 in the morning.

In the latter half of the week, prices will decrease slightly. On **Thursday** and **Friday**, the price level will settle below 4.5 cents. Particularly affordable hours will be available early on **Friday** morning, when the price will drop below two cents.

Wind power production will remain relatively low throughout the week. The average wind power generation will stay below 2500 MW, contributing to higher price levels, especially in the early week. Sunday's low minimum wind power production (480 MW) also explains the risk of price spikes on that specific day.

Overall, next week's price levels will remain moderate. Significant price spikes will appear during individual hours, but average prices will not become particularly high.
