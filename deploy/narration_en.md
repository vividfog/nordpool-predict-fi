Prices over the week will diverge. The highest average price will fall on **Friday**: 17,9 ¢, and the day’s maximum will reach 30,8 ¢. This will be linked to weak wind, as the day’s lowest wind output is expected to drop to 362 MW. Clearly cheaper levels will be seen on **Saturday** and **Sunday**, with averages of 8,2 ¢ and 6,5 ¢. Early in the week, levels will stay in double-digit cents: **Monday** 10,6 ¢, **Tuesday** 14,8 ¢ and **Wednesday** 15,4 ¢. On **Thursday**, the average price will likely ease to 9,2 ¢, and strong wind (avg 4114 MW) will support the lower level.

The risk of price spikes will be elevated on certain days. A risk is flagged on **Sunday**, with a possible peak in the morning at 8:00–10:00. On **Monday** as well, single-hour peaks will be possible in the morning at 8:00–10:00. On **Tuesday**, the risk is high; the forecast peak falls in the evening at 17:00–19:00, with a projected maximum of 23,8 ¢. The day’s higher peak is partly explained by the minimum wind output expected to drop to 616 MW. A high risk is also noted on **Wednesday**; in the morning at 8:00–10:00 the day’s priciest hour is expected, with a forecast maximum of 21,5 ¢.
