|:-------------|:----------------:|:----------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| **Friday** | 11.7 | 2.4 - 23.3 | 606 - 4065 | 5.9 |
| **Saturday** | 9.1 | 4.4 - 15.2 | 831 - 4607 | 5.2 |
| **Sunday** | 5.4 | 2.8 - 7.2 | 3086 - 4672 | 4.7 |
| **Monday** | 10.5 | 3.7 - 19.8 | 984 - 3332 | 4.0 |
| **Tuesday** | 5.1 | 1.8 - 13.3 | 1739 - 4497 | 3.6 |
| **Wednesday** | 2.2 | 0.5 - 4.1 | 4489 - 5032 | 5.0 |
| **Thursday** | 6.3 | 1.0 - 15.6 | 1500 - 4487 | 6.3 |

The weekâ€™s price outlook is expected to split. **Fridayâ€™s** average will be the weekâ€™s highest, 11.7 Â¢, with a forecast peak at 23.3 Â¢. The high would land around 10:00â€“12:00. A low wind minimum (606 MW) helps explain the elevated peak, and individual peak hours could come in higher than forecast.

**On Saturday** a spike risk is expected especially in the morning, with the dayâ€™s high around 08:00â€“10:00 (max 15.2 Â¢). Production swings will be large, and because the wind trough dips to 831 MW, individual peak hours could exceed the forecast.

**On Sunday** the curve will stay low and even; the average is expected at 5.4 Â¢ with a 2.8â€“7.2 Â¢ range. **On Tuesday** the range should remain moderate (1.8â€“13.3 Â¢; avg 5.1 Â¢). **On Wednesday** the weekâ€™s cheapest day is anticipated as the average drops to 2.2 Â¢ and the whole day stays within 0.5â€“4.1 Â¢. Strong wind generation (avg above 3000 MW) will support the low price level on Wednesday.

The other accentuated spikes would be seen **on Monday**, with an evening high around 17:00â€“19:00 (max 19.8 Â¢; avg 10.5 Â¢). **On Thursday** a spike risk would stand out toward early evening, with a high around 17:00â€“19:00 (max 15.6 Â¢; avg 6.3 Â¢).

Overall, the highest daily averages will land on Friday and Monday, while the most affordable day looks to be Wednesday. Price expectations may still change, especially if wind conditions deviate from the forecast.
