Price expectations will remain mostly on an affordable level: on most days the averages will be between 3,8–7,3 ¢. The week’s highest average will be seen on **Tuesday**, at 9,0 ¢. The intraday peak of 13,4 ¢ will likely occur around 15:00–17:00. The higher maximum will be explained by a very low minimum in wind output (269 MW), clearly below 2000 MW. The averages for Wednesday and Thursday will land at 6,5 and 5,4 ¢.

The risk of price spikes will stand out on only two days. **On Wednesday**, a single spike may fall in the morning window of 06:00–08:00. **On Thursday**, a similar window will be around 08:00–10:00. Later in the week, stronger winds will press prices down: the lowest daily averages are projected for **Sunday** (3,8 ¢) and **next Monday** (4,0 ¢). Sunday’s lowest hourly price will occur in the early night, around 02:00–04:00, at 1,7 ¢.
