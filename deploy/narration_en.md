Prices will vary clearly through the week. **Friday** and **Saturday** averages will settle around 8,6–9,4 ¢, and the risk of spikes will be high. Peaks will most likely land on Friday at 08:00–10:00 and 17:00–19:00, and on Saturday at 17:00–19:00. These peaks will be driven by very low minimum wind output (Friday 719 MW, Saturday 288 MW). **Sunday** will be a public holiday, which typically eases demand; the average will drop to 3,4 ¢. Still, a spike risk will be noted, with an intraday high likely around 10:00–12:00.

The week’s highest average will likely come on **Tuesday** at 10,6 ¢, and the morning may top 20 ¢ at 08:00–10:00. **Monday’s** peak will rise around 17:00–19:00 up to 18,4 ¢, linked to a minimum wind level below 2000 MW. The pace will ease midweek: **Wednesday** will average 5,3 ¢, and strong wind (average above 3000 MW) will support a moderate level. **Thursday** will remain reasonable at 5,8 ¢, with no spike risk mentioned.
