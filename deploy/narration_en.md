**On Saturday**, electricity price expectations vary significantly with an average price of 4.9 ¢/kWh. Although the minimum price is only 0.7 ¢, prices are expected to rise to as much as 12.0 ¢ during certain hours. This is partly due to fluctuations in wind power production, which is at its lowest at 459 MW. On **Sunday**, prices are slightly more moderate, with an average of 3.1 ¢, but there remains a risk of price spikes as the maximum price could reach 7.5 ¢.

**On Monday**, the highest prices of the week are expected, with an average price of 6.4 ¢. Wind power production is at its lowest at only 673 MW, which may partly explain the anticipated price spikes, especially during morning and evening hours. **On Tuesday**, prices stabilize slightly, but maximum prices could still rise to 11.1 ¢, partly due to variations in wind power production.

**On Wednesday**, prices are at their lowest for the week, with an average price dropping to 2.1 ¢. This is partly due to increased wind power production. **On Thursday**, the trend continues, and the average price remains low at 2.3 ¢, thanks to strong wind power production.

**On Friday**, prices remain low at the same level of 2.3 ¢. Wind power production remains relatively high, which helps keep prices down.
