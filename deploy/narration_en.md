**On Tuesday**, the average electricity price is expected to be high, at 14.4 cents, mainly due to high prices in the afternoon and evening, when prices rise to as much as 33.3 cents. Wind power production is relatively low on that day, which contributes to the price increase. **On Wednesday**, price expectations are more moderate, with an average price of 7.7 cents, but there could be spikes in individual hours, such as from 10:00 to 12:00.

In the latter half of the week, between **Thursday** and **Friday**, particularly low prices are forecasted, with average prices around 1.2 cents. This is due to strong wind power, exceeding 3000 MW, which keeps prices low. **On Saturday**, electricity prices are expected to drop even further, below one cent, making it the cheapest day of the week.

**On Sunday**, the price might rise slightly, with an average of 1.0 cent. However, there is a risk of price spikes, especially in the evening from 18:00 to 20:00. **Next Monday**, prices will remain low, around 1.8 cents, but occasionally prices might rise, such as in the evening from 20:00 to 22:00.
