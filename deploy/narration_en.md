The week’s price picture will lean on an inexpensive start. Averages will stay below four cents on most days, and brief negative prices will be seen especially on **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**. However, volatility will increase as the week progresses. On **Thursday**, the clearly highest maximum of the week, 17,7 ¢, will be anticipated, and spike risk will be elevated in the evening at 17:00–19:00. The day’s minimum wind output will drop to 954 MW, which helps explain the higher peak. On **Monday**, spike risk will also stand out in the morning at 07:00–09:00.

The late week will offer mixed moments. On **Friday**, a spike could land in the late morning around 10:00–12:00. On **Saturday**, the average price level will remain low. **Sunday** will be a public holiday, but wind will remain very low (avg 899 MW, min 459 MW), which combines with an evening-peak risk at 17:00–19:00; the realized peak could be higher than forecast. Sunday’s daily maximum price is estimated at 17,0 ¢. The week’s cheapest periods will cluster in Tue–Wed night and pre-dawn hours, while the most expensive individual hours will fall on Thursday and Sunday evenings.
