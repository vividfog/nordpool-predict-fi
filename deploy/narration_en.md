The coming week's electricity market prices are expected to vary considerably from day to day. The biggest price differences will occur within weekdays, with clearly lower prices expected during the weekend.

**Wednesday** stands out as the week's most expensive day. The average price will rise to 7,1 cents per kilowatt-hour, with the highest hourly rates anticipated to exceed 16 cents in the morning between 7–9 am. On Wednesday, the risk of price spikes during individual hours is high, meaning actual prices could rise even further. The price increase is partly explained by significantly low wind power generation in the morning, potentially dropping as low as around 300 megawatts.

On **Thursday**, the average electricity price will remain relatively high at 5,8 cents. The highest hourly price of 12,8 cents is expected in the morning between 7–9 am, which may again cause price spikes during certain hours. Thursday's minimum wind power generation will also be notably low, under 200 megawatts, partly explaining the day's elevated peak price.

The price level on **Friday** will decline slightly compared to earlier weekdays, but price fluctuations will continue. The day's average price will settle at 4,4 cents per kilowatt-hour, with the highest price around 10 cents between 7–9 am. The possibility of price spikes also exists on Friday.

The week's most affordable prices will clearly occur during the weekend. On **Saturday**, electricity will cost on average only one cent per kilowatt-hour, with even negative pricing expected around noon. The lowest forecasted hourly price is -0,0 cents at 12 pm. **Sunday** continues the affordable price trend, averaging only 1,3 cents. Negative prices are expected in the early hours between 2–4 am, with the lowest forecasted price at -0,4 cents.

Next **Monday**, prices will again rise closer to the normal weekday level. The day's average price will be 5,1 cents, and prices between 9–11 am will reach around 9 cents. The possibility of price spikes remains for the start of next week as well.
