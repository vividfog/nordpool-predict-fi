*Next week's electricity prices are expected to remain moderate, although Monday and Thursday will see price increases due to reduced wind power availability. Weekend prices are favorable, thanks to abundant wind power supply.*

The upcoming week's electricity market appears variable, but overall prices remain moderate. **Friday** and **Saturday** average prices are affordable, staying below three cents. On these days, the abundance of wind power contributes to the low prices. On Saturday, prices might temporarily rise in the evening, yet they remain moderate.

**Sunday** maintains a low average price, with daily fluctuations between 0.1 and 5.1 cents. Wind power supply continues to be abundant, supporting the low prices. **Monday** sees a noticeable price increase, with the day's average reaching 5.6 cents, partly due to reduced wind power. Evening hours are expected to have the highest prices.

**Tuesday** prices return to a low level, with strong wind power supply. The expected average price for the day is only 2.2 cents, and price fluctuations during the day remain moderate. **Wednesday** sees a slight increase in the average price, but it remains below five cents. On this day, significant variability in wind power production might explain the intra-day price fluctuations.

**Thursday** is expected to have the highest average price of the week at 6.4 cents. Wind power production is significantly lower, which might elevate prices, especially during the evening. On Thursday, there is a risk of peak prices, particularly between 6 PM and 8 PM.
