The upcoming week presents interesting fluctuations in electricity prices. **Tuesday** stands out as the most expensive day, with the average electricity price expected to be 9.8 ¬¢/kWh. Significant price spikes are also anticipated, with the maximum price reaching up to 21.1 cents. These spikes could occur particularly in the evening, around 6-8 PM. The higher price on Tuesday is partly explained by low wind power production, especially in the early and late parts of the day.

On **Wednesday**, the average electricity price drops significantly to 5.2 ¬¢/kWh, though the risk of price spikes remains. Wind power production is variable on Wednesday, but its high peak level may help stabilize prices. Wednesday may prove to be a cheaper day compared to Tuesday, although price expectations are still above average.

The end of the week offers cheaper prices. On **Thursday** and **Friday**, the average electricity price is very low, just 1.0 and 0.4 ¬¢/kWh respectively. Wind power production is expected to be strong, which partly explains the low prices. These days offer consumers affordable electricity use moments without significant risk of price spikes.

Over the weekend, on **Saturday** and **Sunday**, prices remain low, but there is again a possibility of price spikes on Sunday. Sunday's expected average price is 1.5 ¬¢/kWh, but individual peak hours may raise the price, especially in the evening.

Next **Monday**, the average electricity price rises slightly to 2.4 cents, and price spikes are possible during the morning and evening hours. The start of the week shows a slight upward trend in prices, but overall, prices are expected to remain reasonable according to the forecast.
