Next week‚Äôs electricity market will see varied price developments, with **Monday**'s high average price of 13.8 ¬¢/kWh standing out. High maximum prices are also expected on this day, potentially reaching up to 27.5 ¬¢/kWh. This may be due to low wind power production, which is as low as 182 MW. The risk of price spikes is therefore high, especially during morning and afternoon hours.

On **Tuesday**, the average price will drop to 7.1 ¬¢/kWh, but the risk of price spikes remains. This is due to occasionally low wind power production, even though it is expected to average higher during the day. **Wednesday** will see a further decline in electricity prices to an average of 5.5 ¬¢/kWh. Wind power production will fluctuate throughout the day, which may affect price expectations.

**Thursday** and **Friday** will offer more affordable average prices, with Friday's 3.8 ¬¢/kWh standing out as a particularly economical time. During this time, wind power production will be at a high level, lowering the price. Over the weekend, prices will rise again, and on **Saturday** and **Sunday**, the risk of price spikes exists, with average prices ranging from 6.3 to 7.7 ¬¢/kWh.
