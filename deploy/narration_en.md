The electricity price forecast for the upcoming days shows considerable variation. On **Wednesday**, the average market price for electricity will be the highest of the week, approximately 7.3 cents per kilowatt-hour. Prices will fluctuate significantly throughout the day, reaching as low as 2.3 cents and peaking above 13 cents. There is an elevated risk for price spikes particularly in the morning from 7‚Äì9 and again in the evening between 19‚Äì21.

On **Thursday**, the average electricity price will drop markedly from Wednesday's levels. The day's average will be around 3.5 cents, although the highest prices in the morning (between 8‚Äì10) may approach 9 cents. By Thursday evening, prices are expected to fall dramatically, and by midnight heading into Friday, negative electricity pricing is forecasted.

**Friday** will be the week's most affordable day for electricity users. Average prices will hover near zero, at just 0.1 cents. For most of the day, electricity costs will remain below one cent, and during nighttime hours, prices will dip into negative territory. The lowest point will occur early Friday morning between 2‚Äì4, when prices will be around minus one cent.

Weekend prices will remain moderate. On **Saturday**, the average price will be 1.4 cents, but during the morning hours from 9‚Äì11, prices may rise above five cents. There is a noted risk of price spikes during these morning hours. On **Sunday**, the price will remain under one cent on average, though evening prices between 20‚Äì21 will approach four cents.

At the start of the new week on **Monday**, electricity prices will rise slightly. The average will be around 2.3 cents, with evening prices between 19‚Äì21 climbing above six cents. On **Tuesday**, the average price will again decline closer to one cent, and no significant price increases are expected.

This week's fluctuations strongly correlate with wind power generation. The lowest wind power production occurs on Wednesday, partly explaining the day's higher electricity prices. Conversely, exceptionally abundant wind-generated power on Friday will push prices extremely low, at times even negative.
