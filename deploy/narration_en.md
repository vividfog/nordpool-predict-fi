| **Thursday**   | 7.5 | 3.9 - 13.2 | 728 - 3259 | 18.0 |
| **Friday** | 3.4 | 1.2 - 5.4 | 1390 - 4240 | 17.9 |
| **Saturday**  | 3.1 | 1.7 - 5.9 | 2023 - 2505 | 18.0 |

| **Tuesday**   | 5.5 | 2.5 - 10.1 | 1253 - 3279 | 15.0 |

In the electricity market forecast for the week, **Wednesday** stands out with a significantly higher average price of 9.5 Â¢/kWh. The day's maximum price is predicted to reach 17.6 Â¢, which could be due to low wind power production, averaging below 1000 MW. The most significant price spikes may occur during the evening hours around 6-8 PM. **Thursday**, on the other hand, offers slightly cheaper electricity with an average price of 7.5 Â¢, but the risk of price spikes remains.

**Friday** and **Saturday** are expected to be the most affordable days of the week, with average prices at 3.4 Â¢ and 3.1 Â¢. On these days, there is plenty of wind power available, explaining the low prices. **Sunday** continues along the same lines with an average price of 3.1 Â¢.

**Monday** and **Tuesday** show moderate price increases compared to the weekend. On Monday, the average price is 5.0 Â¢ and on Tuesday, 5.5 Â¢. The amount of wind power is predicted to be variable but sufficient to keep prices reasonable.

Overall, the week offers broadly affordable electricity prices, except for **Wednesday**, where the risk of price spikes and a higher average price stand out clearly. The week's weather forecasts do not indicate significant temperature fluctuations that could affect the price.
