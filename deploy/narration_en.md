The week begins on **Tuesday**, when significant price fluctuations are expected on the electricity market. The average price is predicted to be 8.7 ¢/kWh, but there may be substantial variations throughout the day, as the maximum price could rise to 23.8 ¢. This is partly due to the low wind power production, anticipated to drop to 1632 MW.

On **Wednesday**, the risk of price spikes is significant, with the expected average price rising to 11.5 ¢/kWh. Wind power production is forecasted to be at its lowest at 948 MW, which partly explains the high maximum prices that may reach up to 23.0 ¢.

The week continues on **Thursday**, when prices stabilize slightly, with an expected average price of 5.7 ¢/kWh. However, there remains a risk of individual price spikes during the day as wind power production fluctuates.

On **Friday**, more affordable prices are forecasted, with an average of 2.5 ¢/kWh. Wind power production is expected to be at a high level, helping to keep prices low. On **Saturday**, prices drop further, with the day characterized by an especially low average price of 0.3 ¢/kWh, making it the most affordable day of the week.

On **Sunday**, prices rise slightly but remain at an affordable level, with an average price of 2.2 ¢/kWh. There are expected fluctuations throughout the day, but the risk of price spikes is low.

Next **Monday**, prices remain low, with an average forecasted price of 2.1 ¢/kWh. This is due to relatively high wind power production, which helps curb price increases.
