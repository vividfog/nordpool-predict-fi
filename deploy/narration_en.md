| **Thursday** | 1,6 | -0,0 - 3,9 | 6164 - 6994 | 1,4 |

Based on price expectations, the first half of the week will likely stay inexpensive. From **Wednesday** to **Saturday**, average prices would settle between 1,3–2,4 ¢, and the early hours on Friday could even dip negative around 01–03. Strong wind from Wednesday to Thursday would support the low price level. **Sunday’s** average would rise to 4,4 ¢ with wide variation: single-hour prices would reach 11,8 ¢ roughly at 17–19. The risk of price spikes would be concentrated on Sunday, and a very low wind-power minimum, 1 227 MW, would help explain the higher peak.

Toward the end of the period, prices would climb further. **Monday’s** average would be 5,8 ¢ and **Tuesday’s** 6,1 ¢, with Tuesday’s top hour, 10,7 ¢, most likely around 08–10. The cheapest moments of the week would fall at night and in the small hours, while higher prices would appear toward the evening and around Sunday’s peaks.
