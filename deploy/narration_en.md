Early-week pricing will sit high. **Tuesday’s** average will be 14,2 ¢ and **Wednesday’s** 13,1 ¢. A risk of hourly spikes will be flagged for Tuesday and Wednesday: Tuesday’s peak will fall around 08:00–10:00, reaching the day’s high of 22,0 ¢. On Wednesday a similar spike will occur at 08:00–10:00, with a projected maximum of 18,5 ¢. On Tuesday wind power will be low on average (2006 MW), and the minimum will drop to 1098 MW. The week’s highest maximum on the same day will be explained by this low minimum wind output.

The rest of the week will turn clearly cheaper. **Thursday** will ease to an 8,3 ¢ average, and from Friday to Sunday prices will stay below four cents: 4,0 ¢, 3,0 ¢ and 3,6 ¢. Strong winds from Thursday onward will keep the price level low. Next **Monday** the level will rise to 5,6 ¢, yet remain well below early-week values. The cheapest moments of the week will occur on **Saturday** night at 01:00–03:00, when the forecast will be 1,5–1,6 ¢. The priciest hours will appear in Tuesday and Wednesday mornings.
