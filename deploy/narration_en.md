The week’s price trajectory will lean toward clearly higher levels at the start of the week. In particular, **Tuesday** will stand out: the average price is 12,3 ¢ and the maximum is projected at 21,2 ¢. On **Monday** the peak will also run high, at 18,4 ¢. **Saturday’s** daily average will sit near the boundary between expensive and normal, with a top at 14,8 ¢. The week’s lowest averages will land on **Thursday** and **Friday**, clearly under four cents. **Sunday** is a public holiday, which is expected to push prices lower.

Spike risk will be pronounced on several days. On **Saturday**, the risk of individual spikes will be high, most likely around 16:00–18:00, influenced by very calm winds (daily average 772 MW). On **Sunday**, spikes could fall around 17:00–19:00, even though the day is otherwise inexpensive. The higher peaks on **Monday** and **Tuesday** will be explained by weak wind: on both days the wind power minimum stays below 2000 MW, and spikes will concentrate on Monday around 17:00–19:00 and on Tuesday around 08:00–10:00. On **Wednesday**, a single highlight may occur around 08:00–10:00. Low prices on **Thursday** and **Friday** will be supported by strong wind; in addition, Friday’s night-time hours will see intermittent negative prices (around 02:00–04:00).
