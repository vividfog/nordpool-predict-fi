The price outlook for the week is expected to be split: higher average prices at first, but moving to low levels toward the weekend and early next week. **Wednesday** is projected to average 11,3 ¢ with a daily peak near 17,6 ¢ in the early evening around 17:00–19:00. This level will be linked to very low wind output that remains exceptionally subdued through the day (average 478 MW). **Thursday** and **Friday** will carry a risk of single-hour spikes: Thursday’s top stretch will fall in the morning around 08:00–10:00 (max 16,0 ¢), and Friday’s peak will come in the evening around 17:00–19:00 (max 19,0 ¢). Friday’s unusually high maximum occurs while the wind minimum drops below 2000 MW (807 MW), which explains the elevated hourly price. **Saturday** is a public holiday, and demand is expected to be lower than normal; a possible spike will land around midday, roughly 10:00–12:00, but levels will remain clearly below Thursday and Friday.

The most affordable spell will arrive from Sunday through Tuesday. **Sunday** is projected to average just 0,9 ¢, and prices will briefly dip negative in the early hours around 02:00–04:00. **Monday** and **Tuesday** will stay under four cents on average (3,3 ¢ and 1,6 ¢). These levels will be supported by abundant wind generation exceeding 3000 MW on average across all three days.
