Electricity prices in the coming week will remain mostly moderate. Daily average prices will vary from Sunday's negative figure of -0.3 cents up to Tuesday's 2.8 cents. The cheapest day will be **Sunday**, when the average price dips slightly below zero, and during the lowest-priced hours, consumers are effectively paid up to 2.7 cents per kWh. On Sunday, electricity will essentially be free throughout the day.

Prices will rise slightly on **Monday**, with an anticipated average of 1.2 cents. However, price variation within the day will be significant. During the cheapest early morning hours, consumers may be paid up to 1.1 cents per kWh, but between 8–10 a.m., prices are expected to spike briefly to between 2.4 and 5.0 cents. Occasional hourly price spikes may occur.

The week's highest hourly price will occur on **Tuesday** between 9–11 a.m., reaching over eight cents (8.2 ¢). However, Tuesday's lowest prices will still dip slightly negative overnight. On average, Tuesday's price will remain just below three cents, although brief price spikes remain possible during the morning.

On **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, prices will stabilize somewhat, though occasional elevated hourly prices may still occur. Wednesday's highest hourly price of 6.5 cents is forecasted for the evening between 7–9 p.m., whereas Thursday's peak price of just over five cents (5.2 ¢) will occur between 9–11 a.m. Both days will have average prices below three cents.

Toward the week's end, on **Friday** and **Saturday**, prices will decline slightly again. Friday's average price will be about 1.6 cents, and Saturday's prices will dip further toward one cent. However, on Saturday evening between 7–9 p.m., the weekend's highest price peak of 6.2 cents is anticipated. Risk of hourly price spikes is mentioned for these days, so certain hours may deviate from the forecasted prices.

Overall, electricity prices during the week will remain consumer-friendly, although momentary rises will occur, especially during morning and evening hours.
