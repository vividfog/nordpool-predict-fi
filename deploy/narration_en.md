Electricity prices in the upcoming week will vary significantly between days. The average price expectations for **Thursday** and **Friday** are low, at 0.7 Â¢/kWh, due to high wind power production, which may exceed 6000 MW. **Saturday's** price expectations are slightly higher, with an average price of 2.1 Â¢/kWh, and wind power is expected to drop to an average of 2500 MW. There is also a risk of price spikes on Saturday afternoon, where the maximum price could rise to 11.0 Â¢.

On **Sunday**, the average price rises further to 2.9 Â¢/kWh, and wind power remains low, which may increase maximum prices in the afternoon and evening. Sunday's highest price is forecasted at 12.4 Â¢. **Monday** sees prices drop again, with an average price of 1.6 Â¢/kWh, and wind power is expected to remain above 2500 MW, stabilizing the price level.

At the start of the week, **Tuesday's** average price is 1.0 Â¢/kWh, and wind power production is expected to be at a normal level. **Wednesday** sees a significant rise in electricity prices, reaching an average of 4.7 Â¢/kWh, with potential price spikes during the day as the maximum price reaches 12.7 Â¢. This can be explained by lower wind power production, which may drop to as low as 1399 MW.
