Price development for the week will be split in two. The weekend will look inexpensive, Monday will stay near the low-price range, and from Tuesday to Friday the level will turn expensive. Thursday will stand out as the priciest day with an average of 14,6 Â¢ and the highest projected peak at 26,4 Â¢.

**Saturday** and **Sunday**, prices will mostly stay under three to five cents. Strong wind generation in the background will push prices down. The lowest moments of the week will land on the small hours of Sunday around 02:00â€“04:00, when prices will dip to 0,2â€“0,4 Â¢. On Saturday, prices will broadly remain in the one to three cent range.

**Monday** will move to a more moderate level. The daily average will be 4,8 Â¢ with a range of 1,5â€“10,1 Â¢. Some hours will reach around ten cents, but the overall level will remain clearly cheaper than Tuesday.

**Tuesday** will carry a high risk of hourly price spikes. The dayâ€™s highest hour will come in the evening, 16:00â€“18:00 (peak at 17:00). Minimum wind will fall to 821 MW, and this exceptionally low minimum will explain the higher daily maximum (18,9 Â¢) versus early week.

**Wednesday** the spike risk will continue. The highest hour will fall at 16:00â€“18:00 (peak at 17:00), reaching 24,9 Â¢. The dayâ€™s minimum wind output will be 669 MW, a clear reason for the elevated maximum.

**Thursday** the highest risk will be at 17:00â€“19:00 (peak at 18:00). The projected daily maximum will be 26,4 Â¢. Minimum wind will drop to 263 MW, and such a low level will explain the unusually high peak and pricier average.

**Friday** the spike risk will persist. The top hour will hit the morning at 08:00â€“10:00 (peak at 09:00) and reach 25,0 Â¢. Minimum wind will be just 172 MW, explaining the dayâ€™s top levels on individual hours.
