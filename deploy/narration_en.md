The week’s price outlook is expected to be low overall, but two days will stand out. **Friday’s** average price will be 8,6 ¢, and an evening spike risk is forecast for 17:00–19:00 (daily peak 17,4 ¢). **Saturday** is a public holiday, which may lighten demand; still, the average will be 7,3 ¢ and a spike risk is expected in the late morning at 09:00–11:00 (peak 15,1 ¢). On other days the level will remain clearly lower.

On **Sunday** the average will drop to 1,4 ¢, with some hours expected to turn negative. **Tuesday** and **Wednesday** may also see negative minima (−0,1 ¢), with averages of 1,1–1,3 ¢. **Thursday** will edge up to a 2,9 ¢ average, and the lowest hour may dip to −0,3 ¢. The higher peaks on Friday and Saturday are explained by exceptionally weak wind: Friday’s wind minimum is 388 MW and Saturday’s 141 MW. Early in the week, wind production is expected to be plentiful, pressing prices close to zero.
