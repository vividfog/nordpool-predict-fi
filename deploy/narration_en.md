The price trends for the week appear to vary considerably across different days. **Saturday** is expected to have affordable electricity prices, with an average price of 0.7 Â¢/kWh, the lowest during the week. High wind power availability may influence these low prices. On **Sunday**, the price trend could be more volatile, as the maximum price rises to 14.1 Â¢/kWh, and there is a risk of price spikes, especially during the evening hours. **Monday** sees prices rising to an average of 5.7 Â¢/kWh, with a continued risk of price spikes.

On **Tuesday**, prices are expected to be more moderate, with an average of 3.9 Â¢/kWh, but isolated price spikes may occur. **Wednesday** sees prices dropping again, with an average price of 2.4 Â¢/kWh, and wind power production is high, which may partly explain the low prices. **Thursday** stands out as the most expensive day of the week, with an average price of 8.8 Â¢/kWh and a maximum price reaching 17.7 Â¢/kWh, likely due to low wind power availability. **Friday** sees prices stabilizing again, with the average price dropping to 4.1 Â¢/kWh.
