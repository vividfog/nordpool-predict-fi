Electricity prices on the Finnish power exchange for the upcoming week show significant variation between days. **Thursday** stands out with its high average price of 11.2 ¬¢/kWh. Prices during the day can vary considerably, with the predicted maximum price reaching up to 20.6 cents. This may be due to wind power production being at its lowest at only 626 MW.

**Friday** and **Saturday** are expected to be more affordable, with average prices dropping to below four cents. This is partially explained by strong wind power, which remains high at around 4000 MW. Both days have moderate price fluctuations, and significant price spikes are not anticipated.

**Sunday** continues the trend of affordable prices, with an average of 3.3 ¬¢/kWh. However, wind power production is slightly lower compared to the preceding weekend days, but price expectations remain modest.

**Monday** brings slightly higher prices, with an average around 5.6 ¬¢/kWh. Wind power production is forecasted to be at its lowest at 1945 MW, which may slightly raise the price.

**Tuesday** and **Wednesday** forecasts remain at a reasonable level, but **Wednesday** is expected to see individual price spikes. The predicted maximum price on Wednesday rises to 14.0 cents, which may be related to low wind power production during certain hours.
