The coming week offers a diverse price trajectory for electricity. **Monday** is predicted to have the highest prices, with an average price rising to 7.8 ¢/kWh. The risk of price spikes is high, particularly during the morning and evening hours, when prices might soar up to 19.0 ¢/kWh. Wind power production is low, partially explaining the high price level.

**Tuesday** sees a slightly higher average price of 8.5 ¢/kWh. Wind power production temporarily remains below the 1000 MW level, increasing the risk of price spikes. Prices could exceed 15 ¢/kWh at midday and in the evening.

**Wednesday** forecasts a significant drop in price expectations, with an average price of only 2.7 ¢/kWh. Wind power production is anticipated to be strong, which partly explains the price drop. Wednesday's price development seems more stable compared to the beginning of the week.

**Thursday** continues on Wednesday's path, with a predicted average price of 2.5 ¢/kWh. Wind power production remains high, keeping prices low. **Friday** is expected to have an average price of 1.8 ¢/kWh, with wind power production remaining reasonable. The risk of price spikes is lower than at the beginning of the week.

**Saturday** sees further price declines, with a daily average price forecast of 1.6 ¢/kWh. Wind power production is anticipated to be at a normal level, though the risk of price spikes exists. On the last day of the week, **Sunday**, the average price rises to 3.9 ¢/kWh. Wind power production decreases, which could cause price spikes, especially in the evening.
