*The electricity price forecasts for the coming week show significant fluctuations: Thursday and Friday are more expensive days, while Sunday offers the lowest prices. The risk of price spikes is present on several days, particularly in the mornings and evenings.*

The Loviisa 2 nuclear power plant is undergoing a maintenance outage, which began on August 17, 2025, and is expected to end on September 6, 2025. This maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of the electricity price forecast, as training data from periods of maintenance outages is limited.

The forecast was updated on Tuesday at 12:06.

The expected electricity prices for the coming week vary significantly between days. **Thursday** and **Friday** stand out with higher prices, with the average price exceeding five cents. On Thursday in particular, prices could rise to as high as 13.3 cents, the highest expected peak of the week. This high price level can partly be attributed to low wind power production, averaging only 846 megawatts on Thursday.

**Sunday**, on the other hand, offers the cheapest prices of the week, with an average price of less than one cent. On this day, wind power production is remarkably high, which partly explains the low price levels. **Saturday** is also an inexpensive day, with prices remaining moderate and wind power production close to normal levels.

The risk of price spikes is present on most days, especially during morning and evening hours. For example, on **Wednesday** and **Monday**, price spikes may occur in the morning hours, while on **Thursday** and **Friday**, spikes may occur in the afternoon and evening, with prices potentially rising above ten cents.

Overall, the price trend for the week is variable, but Sunday‚Äôs low prices and Thursday‚Äôs high peak prices stand out the most. This provides consumers with the opportunity to plan their electricity usage around the most affordable times.
