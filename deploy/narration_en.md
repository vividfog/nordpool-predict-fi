A clearly higher price level will be expected at the start of the week. **Monday** will stand out as the most expensive day, with an average of 8,6 ¢ and a peak of 16,2 ¢. The risk of hourly spikes will be pronounced in the evening around 17:00–19:00. This will also be indicated by weak winds: minimum wind generation will drop below 1000 MW, which explains the higher peak compared with other days. On **Tuesday** spike risk will be anticipated for the morning, around 07:00–09:00, when the price will reach up to 11,6 ¢. A weak average wind level (below 2500 MW) may also keep early-week levels elevated.

From **Wednesday** onward, the price level will decline. **Wednesday**, **Thursday** and **Friday** will be public holidays, which typically lightens demand. At the same time, winds will strengthen from Thursday, supporting low prices later in the week. **Friday’s** average will be 2,8 ¢, and the cheapest hours will likely occur at night around 01:00–03:00 (down to 0,8 ¢). The weekend will remain inexpensive: on **Saturday** the average will be 3,5 ¢ and on **Sunday** 3,1 ¢. On Sunday the cheapest hours will be in the afternoon around 14:00–16:00, when the level will drop close to two cents.
