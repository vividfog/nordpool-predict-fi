The electricity price forecast for the coming week will show clear variation. The week's highest prices will occur on **Thursday**, when the average daily price will rise to 6.7 cents. Thursday's price range will be wide, with nighttime prices below three cents, but reaching nearly 13 cents around nine in the morning. Additionally, Thursday carries a risk of price spikes during individual hours.

On **Friday**, prices will drop significantly compared to the previous day, with the average price staying below four cents. On Saturday and Sunday, price levels will be clearly the lowest of the week. Saturday's average price will be just 1.7 Â¢, and electricity will be available early Saturday morning for less than half a cent per kilowatt-hour. On Sunday, the minimum price is expected to reach zero cents during early morning hours, essentially meaning free electricity at that time.

At the beginning of next week, price expectations will again rise slightly after the weekend. On **Monday**, the average price will approach five cents, with the day's peak price nearly nine cents at eight o'clock in the morning. On **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, the price level will remain roughly in the same range as on Monday, though Wednesday will see slightly increased price volatility again. On Wednesday morning, electricity prices will peak at almost 11 cents.

Examining the week's price development, it becomes clear that the weekend will offer distinctly cheaper electricity. Compared to the weekend, Thursday's highest price level is particularly noticeable. On other days, prices will remain relatively stable without significant fluctuations, and no special risks of price spikes are expected.
