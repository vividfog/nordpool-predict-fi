In the upcoming week, significant fluctuations are expected in the electricity market, especially on **Wednesday** and **Thursday**. On both days, the average electricity price is forecasted to be 8.5 ¬¢/kWh, which is the highest level of the week. On **Thursday**, the maximum price could rise to as much as 17 ¬¢/kWh, highlighting a particular risk of price spikes. Wind power production is at its lowest on these days, which might partly explain the high prices.

**Tuesday** is also noteworthy in terms of prices, with an average price forecasted at 7.7 ¬¢/kWh and a maximum price potentially reaching 14.3 ¬¢/kWh. Wind power production is variable on Tuesday, adding to the price volatility. The risk of price spikes is also significant on Tuesday.

The cheapest days of the week are expected to be **Saturday** and **Sunday**, with average prices falling below 3 ¬¢/kWh. On **Sunday**, even negative prices are forecasted, which could be due to strong wind power production exceeding 2000 MW. This generally lowers the electricity price.

At the start of the week on **Monday**, the average price is a moderate 4.0 ¬¢/kWh, but individual price spikes may occur. **Friday** sees more moderate average and maximum prices compared to the higher prices in the middle of the week.
