*Electricity prices will fluctuate significantly next week, influenced by wind power production and price spikes on different days. Monday stands out as an expensive day, while Sunday sees record-low prices.*

Next week's electricity prices will vary significantly, as reflected in the forecasts for different days. **On Monday**, the average electricity price is expected to be the highest, at 9.0 cents per kilowatt-hour, making it the most expensive day of the week. The maximum predicted price for this day is 22.1 Â¢, which significantly raises the average price. One reason for this could be the low wind power production, which at times falls to as low as 280 megawatts.

**On Tuesday**, electricity price expectations drop significantly, with an average day price forecasted at just 1.5 Â¢. This is partly due to strong wind power, averaging over 3500 megawatts. On Wednesday, prices rise slightly but remain at a reasonable level, with an average price of 2.9 Â¢. Wind power is lower then, but not exceptionally low.

**On Thursday** and **Friday**, the price level remains fairly stable, around 5 cents. Particularly on Friday, wind power production is at a low level, which may explain the higher peak prices. On Saturday, electricity prices drop again, and on Sunday, they are forecasted to be at their lowest, averaging only 0.5 cents per kilowatt-hour.

There is a risk of price spikes, especially on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday during individual hours. Within these days, the price may momentarily rise to a higher level, particularly during morning and evening hours, as indicated by the forecast's hourly data.
