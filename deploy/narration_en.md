The most expensive day will be **on Wednesday**, with an average price of 13,7 ¢ and a peak reaching 20,8 ¢. The risk of hourly price spikes will be high; morning hours around 8–10 and late afternoon–evening 17–19 will stand out. The peaks will be partly explained by an exceptionally low wind minimum, 308 MW. **On Friday**, pronounced peaks will also appear: the average price will be 12,8 ¢ and upper spikes will reach 17,4 ¢ around 16–18 and 18–20, influenced by a low wind minimum of 1 263 MW. **On Thursday** and **on Saturday**, spike risk will exist, but the overall level will remain clearly lower; Thursday’s peak will land around 8–10 (12,8 ¢) and Saturday in the same window (10,2 ¢).

The cheapest day will be **Sunday**, with the average at 4,8 ¢ and prices dipping overnight at 2–4 a.m. to below three cents. Low levels will be supported by strong wind (average output 3 896 MW). At the end and start of the week, i.e., **on Monday** and **on Tuesday**, average prices will be 8,4 and 8,8 ¢. The cheapest hours will cluster during the night and early morning, while the clearly priciest periods will fall in Wednesday’s and Friday’s late afternoon–evening.
