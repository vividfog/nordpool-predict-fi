*Significant price fluctuations are expected in the Finnish electricity market next week. Particularly Tuesday and Wednesday stand out with high prices, while Friday and Saturday remain exceptionally low due to strong wind power production.*

**The Loviisa 1 nuclear power plant** is currently undergoing maintenance, which started on September 6, 2025, at 10:00 AM and is expected to end on October 2, 2025, at 12:00 PM. This maintenance may affect the accuracy of the forecast because training data from these periods is limited.

The upcoming week offers varying prices in the Finnish electricity market. **Tuesday** will stand out significantly, as the average price rises to the level of 8.5 ¬¢, and the maximum daily price could reach up to 24.6 ¬¢. This may be due to the low minimum wind power production, only 1169 MW, combined with high electricity demand, which temporarily raises the price. **Wednesday** continues the trend of high prices, with an expected average price of 13.0 ¬¢, and the maximum price may rise to 26.8 ¬¢. On these days, the risk of price spikes is significant, with the highest prices likely occurring during morning and evening hours.

The cheapest days of the week are expected to be **Friday** and **Saturday**, when average prices drop below one cent. On Friday and Saturday, wind power production is strong, which contributes to lowering prices. The price range on these days extends from negative prices to just over a two-cent maximum.

**Thursday** appears to be a moderate day in terms of prices, with an average price of 4.7 ¬¢. Price fluctuations remain moderate, and wind power production remains reasonable throughout the day. **Monday** also offers relatively affordable prices, but there is a risk of price spikes during individual hours, when prices may temporarily rise.

On Sunday, price fluctuations are also observed, but the average price remains moderate at the level of 5.0 ¬¢. On Sunday, wind power production is variable, which may affect price development during the day.
