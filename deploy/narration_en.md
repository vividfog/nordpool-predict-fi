Price expectations for the week will dip clearly between Wednesday and Saturday: average prices will be 1,2–2,6 ¢. Strong wind generation will explain the low price level especially from Wednesday to Friday. Nighttime dips will turn briefly negative on Friday and Saturday, roughly at 01–03 and 00–02.

Price variation will increase at the start and end of the week. On **Monday**, spike risk will be high, and the evening peak will fall around 17–19; the anticipated maximum is 18,2 ¢ (avg 10,8 ¢). On **Tuesday**, the peak will likely land in the 08–10 morning window; the projected maximum of 19,3 ¢ is the week’s highest and is associated with an exceptionally low wind-power minimum (836 MW). On **Sunday**, spikes are again expected in the evening, around 17–19, when the anticipated maximum is 15,2 ¢ (avg 6,4 ¢). During peak hours, realized prices on these days may end up higher than forecast.
