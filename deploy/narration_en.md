In the coming week, there will be significant fluctuations in electricity markets. **Tuesday** starts the week moderately, but price spikes may occur occasionally, especially in the afternoon when the maximum price could rise to 7.9 cents. Wind power production is at its lowest on Tuesday, which may contribute to the price increase. **Wednesday** is forecasted to have a slightly higher average price of 4.7 cents, and the risk of price spikes remains possible. Wind power production is at its lowest on Wednesday, which may partly explain the higher prices.

On Thursday, price trends calm down, and the average price decreases to 2.9 cents. Wind power production is higher on Thursday, which may partly push prices down. **Friday** sees a slight increase in prices, with an average price of 3.6 cents, but price spikes may occur in the evening. Saturday offers the lowest prices of the week, with an average price of just 0.8 cents. Wind power production is at its peak then, which partly explains the low prices.

**Sunday** sees record low prices, with even negative hours expected. Sunday's average price is -0.2 cents, and wind power production is at a high level, supporting low prices. Next Monday, prices rise slightly but remain moderate, with an average price of 1.8 cents.
