The price level will vary clearly. Average prices will stay mostly under four cents from Wednesday to Saturday, but estimates will climb after that. Tuesdayâ€™s average will be 11,3 Â¢, which will push the weekâ€™s overall picture higher. The week will therefore feature both inexpensive and markedly pricier hours.

**Wednesday** and **Thursday** are expected to see plenty of wind power (average outputs 5663 and 4215 MW), which will push prices down. On Thursday the minimum is expected to dip slightly below zero, to -0,1 Â¢. **Saturday** will remain windy and the lowest price is forecast to drop to -0,7 Â¢, most likely in the morning hours (around 06:00â€“08:00). On these days, price variation will stay moderate.

During **Friday** and **Sunday** the wind will be clearly weaker (averages 1919 and 2398 MW). On Friday the risk of price spikes in individual hours will stand out in the late morning, around 10:00â€“12:00, when the price will reach 9,6 Â¢. On Sunday the risk will concentrate in the afternoon, around 15:00â€“17:00, with a top at 6,1 Â¢. On both days the minimum wind output will fall below 2000 MW (935 MW on Friday, 1423 MW on Sunday), which explains the higher peaks.

**Monday** will see a minimum output of 1702 MW and the dayâ€™s top price is estimated at 11,1 Â¢. The risk for individual-hour spikes will appear before prime time, around 17:00â€“19:00. **Tuesday** will be notably calm: average output will be 1435 MW and the minimum only 517 MW. A high risk of price spikes is indicated for this day, with the greatest likelihood in the early evening, around 16:00â€“18:00. The daily average will climb to 11,3 Â¢ and the maximum is forecast at 22,7 Â¢, clearly above 20 Â¢. Weak wind explains both the high average and the hourly peaks.
