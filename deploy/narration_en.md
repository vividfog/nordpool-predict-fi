The week will appear mostly affordable: on most days, average prices will stay clearly below four cents. The overall level will remain low particularly on days with strong wind. In some periods, prices will briefly turn negative; this will likely occur especially on **Wednesday**, **Friday**, and **Saturday** during the night and early morning hours.

However, **Thursday** will stand out. The dayâ€™s average price is forecast at 5,7 Â¢ and the maximum at 16,2 Â¢. The risk of single-hour price spikes will be elevated, and the highest level is expected in the evening, roughly at 17:00â€“19:00. Within the day, wind powerâ€™s minimum output will drop to about 1002 MW, which explains the higher maximum compared with other days. On the other days, price variation will remain more moderate, and the cheapest hours will be concentrated in the night and early morning.
