The weekend would remain inexpensive. In particular, the small hours of **Friday** would briefly dip below zero, and the day’s average would stay under one cent. **Monday** would climb clearly to the week’s highest levels: the average at 9.2 ¢ and the peak at 16.4 ¢ around 17:00–19:00. The spike would be explained by an exceptionally low minimum wind output (825 MW). On **Tuesday**, the average would be 8.9 ¢, with individual spikes likely around 08:00–10:00. On both early‑week days, winds would be generally weak, supporting the higher price level.

Midweek, prices would ease as **Wednesday** and **Thursday** are public holidays; average prices 6.7 ¢ and 5.3 ¢. The cheapest moments of the week would occur on Friday night and early morning, when prices dip below zero. The most expensive hour would likely land on Monday evening around 17:00–19:00, clearly above 15 ¢. Overall, the focus would shift from low weekend prices to costlier early‑week hours before the holidays steady the situation again.
