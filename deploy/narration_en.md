The early week will be inexpensive. On **Wednesday**, the average price is expected to settle at 3.0 ¢, and the night will likely dip close to zero at 00:00–02:00. Abundant wind power will support Wednesday’s low level. **Friday’s** average rises to 10.1 ¢ and a risk of spikes in individual hours is noted; the largest peak leans toward the morning at 09:00–11:00 (16.3 ¢). On **Saturday**, a public holiday may lighten demand and press prices down; the average stays at 5.3 ¢, but isolated spikes may appear in the morning at 08:00–10:00. On **Sunday**, the level will remain near Saturday (avg 5.2 ¢).

At the start of the new week, **Monday’s** average will rise to 8.4 ¢ and a spike risk is present. The day’s peak will likely fall in the morning at 08:00–10:00 (12.0 ¢). On **Tuesday**, the week’s highest average is expected, 12.1 ¢, with a maximum of 20.0 ¢ in the morning at 08:00–10:00. Tuesday’s exceptionally high peak is explained by a very low wind-power minimum (654 MW), clearly below 2,000 MW.
