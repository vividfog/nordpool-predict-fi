**Wednesday** brings exceptionally low electricity prices, with the average remaining at 0.6 cents per kilowatt-hour. There is plenty of wind power, which partly explains the low price level. **On Thursday**, prices remain moderate, and abundant wind power helps keep prices in check.

**Friday** presents a possibility for price spikes during the morning and evening hours. Wind power production fluctuates greatly, which could impact price increases. Similarly, **on Saturday** and **Sunday**, price spikes are expected, especially in the afternoon and evening hours. Wind power production is lower on these days, which partly explains the higher price expectations.

**On Monday**, the average price rises to 10.4 cents per kilowatt-hour, making it the most expensive day of the week. This is partly due to the limited wind power. **On Tuesday**, prices stabilize again as wind power production increases, and the average price drops to 5.6 cents.
