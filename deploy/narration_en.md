*Earlyâ€‘week power prices are expected to be higher and more variable, with Tuesday clearly the most expensive as spike risk centers on the late morning; later in the week prices will level off and turn low, especially on Thursday and Sunday, though Saturday may see isolated evening increases.*

The week will be clearly split in two. On **Monday**, the average price will be expected to settle around 7â€“8 cents, with wide variation as the lowest hours dip near zero and prices rise toward the evening. **Tuesday** will stand out as the weekâ€™s most expensive: the daily average will be 17,8 Â¢ and the top hour will reach 31,1 Â¢.

On **Tuesday**, the risk of price spikes will be high. Peaks will concentrate in the late morning, around 09:00â€“11:00. Minimum wind output will drop clearly below 2â€¯000 MW (471 MW), and this exceptionally low hourly production will explain the weekâ€™s highest maximum price. Average wind output will also be very low (907 MW), which will support the elevated price level. On **Wednesday**, the spike risk will continue, with morning peaks around 08:00â€“10:00, when the top hour will rise to 25,2 Â¢. The dayâ€™s average will remain clearly below Tuesdayâ€™s but will still stay in double digits.

On **Thursday**, the price level will be expected to be low and even, with abundant wind throughout the day. The price band will remain within 1,5â€“3,7 cents, and no major swings will be forecast. On **Sunday**, another very inexpensive day will be seen: the average will be 2,3 Â¢ with a lot of wind expected. The evening will dip near the weekâ€™s lows, roughly 20:00â€“22:00 at 1,0â€“1,2 Â¢.

**Fridayâ€™s** price level will settle clearly below Wednesdayâ€™s. Intraday variation will be moderate, and the top hour will be limited to 11,2 Â¢. On **Saturday**, the overall level will be close to Fridayâ€™s, but there will be a risk of isolated evening peaks: around 19:00â€“21:00 the weekendâ€™s highest level will be reached, at most 11,8 Â¢.

In the weekâ€™s overall picture, earlyâ€‘week prices will at times climb very high, whereas later in the week several hours will drop below four cents. The cheapest periods will concentrate on Thursday and Sunday evening, while the weekâ€™s most expensive hours will fall on Tuesday late morning.
