Price expectations will stay mostly between 5 and 8 cents from **Wednesday** to **Saturday**, but isolated spikes are forecast. **Thursday** carries a noted risk for peak hours; the day’s highest prices are set to land around 15:00–17:00 (forecast maximum 9,0 ¢). **Friday’s** average price will be the week’s highest at 8,2 ¢, and the maximum will rise to 14,7 ¢ around 18:00–20:00. Friday’s peak is explained by an exceptionally low minimum wind output of 1370 MW. On **Saturday** the spike risk is elevated; the morning window 07:00–09:00 climbs to about 14,3 ¢.

The most affordable overall picture will appear on **Sunday** and **Monday**: averages will stay at 3,2–3,3 ¢ and the lowest hours dip to about 1,5 ¢ and 0,5 ¢. Sunday’s lowest stretch will occur around 20:00–22:00 and on Monday at 02:00–04:00. The week will close on **Tuesday** at a clearly mid-range 5,5 ¢ average; the day’s highs will fall around 17:00–19:00 (up to 10,2 ¢). These lower levels will be supported by strong wind on Sunday and Monday, averaging over 4000 MW.
