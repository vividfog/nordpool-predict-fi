At the weekend and at the start of the week, prices are expected to rise noticeably in individual hours. On **Friday**, peaks will concentrate between 17:00–19:00. **Saturday** is expected to stand out as the week’s most expensive: the average price will be 10,1 ¢ and the maximum is forecast at 18,4 ¢. Spike risk is most likely from 17:00–19:00, and elevated prices are also expected in the morning from 08:00–10:00. The day’s minimum wind output drops to 248 MW, which explains the high maximum price. On **Monday**, peak hours will fall between 17:00–19:00. On **Tuesday**, both the morning 08:00–10:00 and the evening 17:00–19:00 will stand out; the day’s high is 17,1 ¢.

**Sunday** is a public holiday, so demand will be lower and the average price will drop to 3,1 ¢; a small peak may be seen from 10:00–12:00. The most affordable days will land midweek: **Wednesday** will stay below five cents and **Thursday** around 3,4 ¢. On these days, strong wind (over 3000 MW) will support the low price level. The cheapest hours will generally be at night and during Thursday’s daytime and evening hours, while the week’s most expensive hours will concentrate on Friday and Saturday evenings.
