| **Tuesday** | 16,7 | 6,4 - 28,1 | 527 - 1502 | 6,4 |
| **Wednesday** | 9,8 | 0,9 - 20,4 | 708 - 4219 | 6,4 |
| **Thursday** | 1,1 | -0,2 - 2,6 | 3768 - 5875 | 7,5 |
| **Friday** | 3,1 | 0,8 - 6,1 | 2957 - 4568 | 5,9 |
| **Saturday** | 4,9 | 1,2 - 8,4 | 1464 - 4056 | 5,2 |
| **Sunday** | 2,3 | 1,1 - 3,4 | 3517 - 4657 | 4,7 |
| **Monday** | 7,9 | 2,8 - 14,3 | 839 - 4236 | 4,0 |

The week will split clearly in two. **Tuesday** stands out as the most expensive: the average price is expected to rise to 16,7 cents and the peak to 28,1 ¢. Behind this is a very low average wind power output, about 893 MW. The highest hours will cluster in late morning, 9–11, and in the evening, 18–20, when the risk of spike pricing will be elevated.

**Wednesday** the level will ease, with the average at 9,8 ¢. The risk of single-hour spikes will nevertheless remain high. The morning high will likely fall around 8–10, when the forecast’s top hourly price is 20,4 ¢. Intraday variation will be large, which will also show up as cheaper evening hours as wind production strengthens.

**Thursday**–**Sunday** will form an inexpensive stretch. On Thursday the average will drop to 1,1 ¢ and there will even be slightly negative hourly prices. Abundant wind power will explain the drop, especially on Thursday (avg. 5006 MW) and Sunday (avg. 4272 MW). On **Friday** the average will stay at 3,1 ¢ and on **Saturday** at 4,9 ¢. On these days the price level will remain even without a separate spike risk.

Next **Monday** prices will rise back toward the middle range, with the average at 7,9 ¢. Average wind output will remain fairly low (2166 MW), and the risk of single-hour spikes will be elevated. The highest hours will most likely concentrate in the evening, 18–20, when the forecast peak will be 14,3 ¢.

The week’s cheapest hours will fall on Thursday, while the week’s clearest peaks will appear around Tuesday’s morning and evening. Price expectations may still shift if the wind forecast changes, but the direction will be clear: midweek and the weekend will stay inexpensive, whereas Tuesday and next Monday will stand out as higher.
