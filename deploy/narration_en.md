During the coming week, electricity prices on the market are set to vary considerably. **Friday** stands out with the highest maximum price, potentially reaching up to 7.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. This might partly be due to the forecasted low wind power production at only 216 megawatts. However, the average price remains moderate at 3.7 cents.

On **Saturday**, prices are expected to decrease slightly, with the average price at 2.4 Â¢/kWh. Wind power production is also forecasted to be at a higher level, which could partly contribute to the lowering prices. On **Sunday**, the average price will be remarkably low at 0.9 cents, with the day's lowest price potentially negative. This is partly due to the diverse wind power production expected that day.

At the beginning of the week, from **Monday** to **Wednesday**, electricity prices are more stable, with average prices ranging from 3.0 to 3.1 cents. Wind power production is expected to be relatively steady during this period. On **Thursday**, the maximum price might again rise to 7.3 cents, although the average price remains reasonable at 3.3 cents. The day's wind power production is expected to be relatively low, which might partly explain the price increase.
