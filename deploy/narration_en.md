Weekly price development will skew toward a cheap late-week stretch. The highest daily average would be seen on **Wednesday**, at 7,6 ¢, while **Tuesday’s** average will be 6,5 ¢. For Tuesday, a risk of individual price spikes is flagged; based on the hourly profile, around 07–09 in the morning would see the week’s top level, 11,2 ¢. Tuesday’s very low minimum wind output, 864 MW, explains the highest maximum price.

Later in the week, strong winds will push prices down: **Friday’s** average is 2,4 ¢ and **Saturday’s** 1,4 ¢. On Saturday morning, prices will briefly dip below zero (down to -0,3 ¢), roughly at 05–07. On **Sunday**, the level will return closer to early week, with a 6,1 ¢ daily average and an evening peak around 10,6 ¢ at 18–20. Next **Monday** will again remain moderate at 3,5 ¢.
