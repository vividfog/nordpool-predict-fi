*Electricity prices are expected to fluctuate significantly in the coming days as wind power production and maintenance outages impact forecasts. Price spikes are likely on Sunday and Thursday, which may considerably increase costs.*

Maintenance outages are underway at the Loviisa nuclear power plants. Loviisa 1 has been offline since September 6, 2025, at 10:00, and is expected to return on September 24, 2025, at 00:00. Loviisa 2 has been under maintenance since August 17, 2025, at 04:00, with an anticipated end date of September 13, 2025, at 00:00. These outages may affect the forecast's accuracy, as there is limited training data available from the periods of these outages.

The forecast was updated on Thursday at 09:07.

| **Friday** | 0.9 | -0.2 - 2.3 | 4366 - 6070 | 16.1 |
| **Saturday** | 0.6 | -0.7 - 4.8 | 2225 - 4148 | 14.5 |
| **Sunday** | 4.1 | -0.8 - 18.3 | 820 - 3444 | 14.6 |
| **Monday** | 2.9 | 0.7 - 6.0 | 1232 - 2978 | 14.2 |
| **Tuesday** | 2.4 | -0.9 - 8.1 | 1447 - 3453 | 13.5 |

| **Thursday** | 3.7 | -0.3 - 13.5 | 1095 - 3310 | 12.6 |

**Friday** is expected to be quite stable in terms of daily prices, remaining below 2.5 cents. Wind power production is notably strong, supporting the low prices. **Saturday** continues with moderate prices, even as wind power production decreases. **Sunday** is expected to be significantly more expensive, with a likely risk of price spikes, particularly in the evening, when prices may exceed 18 cents.

**Monday** sees a slight drop in prices from Sunday, although the risk of price spikes remains, especially in the afternoon and evening. **Tuesday** sees further price reductions, remaining at a reasonable level, but the risk of price spikes persists in the morning and evening. **Wednesday** prices remain stable with a low risk of price spikes. **Thursday** is again expected to have potential price spikes, particularly in the afternoon and evening, with prices possibly exceeding 13 cents.

As the week concludes, variations in wind power production impact price predictability. The effects of wind power and maintenance outages on forecasts may lead to changes in price expectations. *Future electricity markets analyzed by gpt-4o.* üîç
