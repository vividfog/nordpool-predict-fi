The upcoming week appears to be quite steady in terms of electricity price trends. **Wednesday** stands out with the lowest average price at -0.5 ¬¢/kWh, which is explained by the strong wind power production forecasted at an average of 3804 MW. Similarly, **Saturday** is expected to have a negative average price of -0.5 ¬¢/kWh. On these days, strong wind power reduces prices.

**Monday**, on the other hand, stands out with the highest average price at 2.5 ¬¢/kWh. This is due to the low wind power production forecasted at an average of only 1204 MW, which raises the price level. There is also a potential for price spikes on Monday during specific hours, particularly in the mornings and evenings.

Over the weekend, on **Friday** and **Sunday**, some price fluctuations can be observed, but overall they remain affordable. On Sunday, the maximum price is expected to be 2.9 ¬¢/kWh, which is the highest single price of the week, yet still reasonable.

Overall, the forecasts indicate a fairly stable week in terms of prices, with no significant spikes or exceptions. **Monday** is the most notable day for higher prices, but otherwise, the week offers affordable moments for electricity consumers.
