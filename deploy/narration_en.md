|  | avg-<br>price<br>¢/kWh | min - max<br>¢/kWh | wind power<br>min - max<br>MW | avg-<br>temperature<br>°C |
|:-------------|:----------------:|:----------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| **Tuesday** | 10,4 | 3,5 - 17,9 | 567 - 2681 | 1,1 |
| **Wednesday** | 7,2 | 4,1 - 15,4 | 262 - 3856 | 1,5 |
| **Thursday** | 3,9 | 2,0 - 6,0 | 2270 - 4431 | 1,6 |
| **Friday** | 6,7 | 1,8 - 12,2 | 1453 - 4184 | -0,0 |
| **Saturday** | 5,6 | 3,2 - 9,1 | 1411 - 4336 | -2,6 |
| **Sunday** | 3,6 | 1,4 - 7,0 | 2262 - 4357 | -0,8 |
| **Monday** | 5,7 | 1,9 - 11,4 | 2272 - 4359 | 1,9 |

The price level will split between the start and the end of the week. On **Tuesday**, the average price is expected at 10,4 cents and the daily peak at 17,9 ¢, making it the week’s standout. On **Wednesday**, the peak remains at 15,4 ¢ and the average at 7,2 cents. Later in the week levels will ease: on **Thursday** and **Sunday** the averages settle at 3,9 and 3,6 cents, and abundant wind power on these days supports the low prices.

The risk of price spikes will be elevated on **Tuesday**, **Wednesday**, and **Friday**. Tuesday’s evening peak will likely fall around 17–19, and the very low minimum wind output (567 MW) explains the high maximum price. **Wednesday’s** spike will concentrate in the morning around 07–09. On **Friday**, isolated peaks may occur in the early evening at 17–19. The week’s cheapest hours will likely fall during **Thursday’s** and **Sunday’s** night-time, when the price dips to about 1,4–2,0 cents.
