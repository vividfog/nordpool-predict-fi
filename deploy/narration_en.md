Electricity market prices will experience moderate day-to-day fluctuations next week. Price forecasts will remain relatively stable, with no exceptionally high average prices anticipated for individual days. The most expensive days of the week are expected to be **Monday**, **Tuesday**, and **Wednesday**, with average prices around 4.6‚Äì4.8 cents. However, individual higher price peaks may occur, especially during morning and evening hours on these days.

On **Monday**, prices will vary between 2.1 and 8.9 cents. In the evening between approximately 18:00‚Äì20:00, the price may approach nine cents per kilowatt-hour. On **Tuesday**, the maximum price will be slightly lower at 7.8 cents, with peak hours occurring in the morning around 08:00‚Äì10:00. On **Wednesday**, the highest hourly price of the week, 9.4 cents, is expected around 09:00 in the morning. Short-term price spikes are possible on these three days.

The most affordable days of the week will be **Saturday** and **Sunday**, with daily electricity prices remaining low. On Saturday, the average price will be very low at only 0.7 cents, and during certain nighttime hours, prices may even turn negative. Negative prices will also occur early on Sunday morning, but the daily average will be slightly higher, about two cents.

Towards the end of the week, prices will gradually decrease. On **Thursday**, the average price will settle at 3.5 cents, and hourly prices will not rise above seven cents. On **Friday**, prices will continue their declining trend, with the daily average dropping to 2.6 cents. Friday's highest hourly prices will remain moderate, peaking at 4.4 cents.

Wind power will partly contribute to the weekend's lower prices, as production will be abundant on Saturday and Sunday. During weekdays, wind power production will be somewhat lower, but still sufficient, so no significant price pressures resulting from wind power shortages are expected.
