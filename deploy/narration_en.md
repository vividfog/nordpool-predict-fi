In the coming week, electricity price expectations vary moderately, but individual price spikes may occur. **Friday** and **Saturday** are forecasted to have affordable prices, with average prices below 3 cents. **Sunday** is expected to have the lowest average price of the week at 1.8 cents, but also the highest maximum price of 6.3 cents, which could highlight notable spikes.

**Monday** stands out with a higher average price of 3.4 cents, due to lower wind power production. This may elevate evening price spikes, particularly between 7 PM and 9 PM. **Tuesday** and **Wednesday** bring varying price expectations, but wind power production remains at conventional levels.

Next **Thursday** appears to be more balanced in terms of weekly price development, though individual price spikes may be expected in the evening. Over the weekend, temperatures remain on average above 18 degrees, which does not significantly impact price development.
