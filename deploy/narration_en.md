The coming days' electricity price forecasts reveal clear variations. The highest prices will occur on **Thursday**, with the day's average price expected to reach 6.6 cents per kilowatt-hour. During Thursday, hourly prices will fluctuate significantly, ranging from a low of 1.9 cents to a daily peak of 13.0 cents. Prices will particularly rise in the morning between 7–9 and again in the evening from 18–21. Thursday also carries a heightened risk of price spikes during individual hours.

**Saturday** will be the week's most affordable day for electricity consumers. The day's average price will fall to just 1.3 cents, and during some nighttime hours, electricity prices are expected to even become negative. Saturday's lowest price will be -0.4 cents between 4–5 a.m. Even during the daytime and evening hours, prices will remain moderate, peaking at just 3.5 cents. However, Saturday still carries a heightened risk of individual hourly price spikes, despite generally low prices.

On **Friday** and **Sunday**, electricity prices will also remain at low levels. Both days' average prices will stay below four cents. Sunday will again feature particularly affordable moments, especially early in the morning between 1–2 a.m., when the electricity price will dip to -0.5 cents.

At the beginning of next week, electricity prices will rise slightly. On **Monday** and **Tuesday**, average prices will hover around five cents, somewhat higher than the exceptionally low weekend prices. On **Wednesday**, the average price will climb a bit further to 5.3 cents, with hourly prices varying between two and nearly 12 cents. Particularly on Wednesday morning between 8–10, prices will peak at 11.6 cents, marking the highest hourly prices of the latter half of the week.

Thus, electricity price variations will be considerable during the coming week, and electricity consumers may want to pay special attention to the affordable weekend hours and possible peak prices on Thursday.
