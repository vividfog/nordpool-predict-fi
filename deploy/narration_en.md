The week’s price level will vary: On **Tuesday**, the average price is expected to rise to 8,0 ¢ and the maximum is forecast at 11,9 ¢. On **Wednesday**, the average will stay almost the same, at 7,9 ¢, and the highest hourly price is estimated at 11,5 ¢. On **Thursday**, the level will ease toward a 6,1 ¢ average, but the day’s top hour, 9,7 ¢, will stand out in the evening. The week’s cheapest day is expected to be **Saturday**, with an average of 1,5 ¢ and a narrow 0,7–2,2 ¢ range.

Spike risk for individual hours will be signaled only on two days: On **Tuesday**, an elevated evening peak will most likely fall between 17:00–19:00. The peak will be backed by a low minimum in wind output (about 1 800 MW) on the same day. On **Thursday**, a similar risk will concentrate around 20:00–22:00, with an exceptionally low wind minimum (about 1 100 MW) in the background. Stronger winds later in the week will push prices down, most clearly seen in Saturday’s even and very low levels.
