The week will stand out with two expensive days. **Friday** will see an average price of 15,0 ¢, and the daily peak will reach 21,6 ¢, reflecting very weak wind (min 352 MW). The priciest hours will fall between 08–10. On **Saturday**, a public holiday, demand will likely be lower and the average around 5,8 ¢. However, the risk of hourly price spikes will increase in the morning, most likely 08–10. **Sunday** will be the cheapest day (avg 3,7 ¢), with a steady price level.

At the start of the week, on **Monday** the average will be around 7,8 ¢. On **Tuesday** the average will rise to 12,4 ¢ and the day’s peak to 21,4 ¢. A high risk of price spikes will stand out, especially between 08–10 and 15–17. Behind this is low minimum wind output (598 MW), which explains the higher peak price. On **Wednesday** and **Thursday** the price level will settle near 6,6 ¢. The moderately low prices on these days will be supported by plentiful wind, averaging above 3000 MW.
