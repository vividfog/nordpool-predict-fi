The week's price trends show significant differences between the days. **Monday** stands out with a high average price of 9.0 ¢, and the maximum price rises to 22.1 ¢. This may be related to low wind power production during the day. On Tuesday, prices are expected to drop significantly, with an average price of just 1.5 ¢ and strong wind power production explaining the lower costs.

On **Wednesday**, the average price is slightly higher at 2.9 ¢, and there is a risk of price spikes during the day. Wind power production is lower, which may affect prices. **Thursday** sees prices expected to rise, with an average price of 5.4 ¢, and the minimum wind power production is low, raising maximum prices and increasing the risk of price spikes.

**Friday** continues a similar trend, with an average price of 4.0 ¢, and the minimum wind power is again low, which could cause price spikes during certain hours. On **Saturday**, prices drop to 2.3 ¢, but the risk of price spikes still exists.

The week ends on **Sunday** with a low average price of 0.9 ¢, and the day features strong wind power production, keeping prices low. The weekend thus offers more affordable electricity prices than the start of the week.
