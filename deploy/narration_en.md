**Thursday** will likely see moderate price levels, but isolated hours will carry spike risk: the evening peak would fall around 17:00–19:00 (about 8,9 ¢). **Friday** is projected to average 8,2 ¢, with the day’s top hour standing as the week’s high at 14,3 ¢ in the early evening, around 16:00–18:00. The higher maximum is explained by wind output dipping to a minimum of 1827 MW (below 2000 MW). **Saturday** would focus its spike risk in the morning, 07:00–09:00, when prices are expected to touch 13,2 ¢.

The week’s cheapest hours would likely occur on the night leading into **Monday**, 03:00–05:00, at roughly 0,2–0,6 ¢. **Sunday** and **Tuesday** would hold averages around 4,0–4,9 ¢. On these days, wind output would be plentiful (around 3758–3843 MW on average), supporting lower prices. Overall, the week is expected to be reasonably priced, with most days hovering near five cents, and the clearest outlier being Friday’s evening peak.
