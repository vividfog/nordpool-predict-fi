**Tuesday** is forecasted to be the cheapest day of the week, with an average electricity price of just 0.8 cents per kilowatt-hour. Wind power is predicted to be abundant, which contributes to lowering the price.

On **Wednesday**, prices remain moderate with an average of 0.3 cents, partly due to abundant wind power. **Thursday's** average price rises to 2.8 cents, and individual hourly price spikes are possible if wind power production significantly decreases.
