In the coming days, electricity market prices are expected to vary significantly. **On Wednesday**, the average price is expected to be 5.5 ¢/kWh, with daily prices ranging from 0.3 to 13.6 cents. This large variation suggests possible price spikes, particularly in the evening. Wind power production is generally calm on Wednesday, which may contribute to higher prices.

**Thursday** and **Friday** are expected to see notable price spikes, with average prices at 7.3 ¢ and 6.3 ¢/kWh, respectively. On both days, wind power production remains low, pushing prices upward. Thursday's maximum forecast price is 13.3 ¢, and on Friday, it could rise to 14.3 ¢. This may result in high prices, especially during morning and evening hours.

Over the weekend, **Saturday** and **Sunday** are predicted to have moderate prices. On Saturday, the average price is 3.9 ¢/kWh, and on Sunday, it drops even further to 1.5 ¢. Sunday's prices remain particularly low due to abundant wind power production, which can exceed 3000 MW.

Next **Monday**, the average price rises again to 4.3 ¢, and individual hourly prices may vary between 0.2 and 11.7 ¢. This indicates potential price spikes during evening hours when wind power is minimal. Next **Tuesday**, prices rise to an average of 5.9 ¢, with intra-day fluctuations reaching up to 11.0 ¢, especially during the morning and evening.
