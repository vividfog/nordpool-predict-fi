Wednesday stands out in the week's price development with the highest predicted average price of 10.5 cents per kilowatt-hour, and a peak price reaching up to 19.6 cents. This may be due to the low minimum wind power production, which drops to 1116 megawatts, potentially increasing electricity prices, especially in the afternoon and evening hours. Price spikes may occur particularly between 5 PM and 7 PM.

On Thursday, electricity is expected to be cheaper, with an average price of 4.7 cents. Although wind power production rises significantly, reaching up to 4130 megawatts, individual hours still hold the potential for price spikes.

Friday and the weekend days offer notably low prices, with Friday's average price at only 1.9 cents and Saturday dropping to 0.1 cents. Sunday's average price remains low at 0.6 cents, and minimum prices become negative over the weekend, indicating high supply.

Next Monday, the price trend changes again as the average price rises to 5.3 cents, and the peak price could reach 16 cents. This is likely due to the low minimum wind power production, forecasted at only 737 megawatts. On Tuesday, high prices are still predicted, with the average price rising to 8.6 cents and the peak price reaching up to 20.3 cents, increasing the risk of price spikes, particularly between 6 PM and 8 PM.
