Next **Saturday**, the average electricity price is expected to be low, around 4 cents per kilowatt-hour, but price fluctuations may still surprise, as there is a risk of individual price spikes. On Sunday, prices are forecasted to rise, with an average price of 7.3 Â¢/kWh. The highest price of the day may reach up to 16.5 Â¢, and combined with weak wind power production, this may lead to significant price spikes.

On **Monday**, a similar trend to Sunday is expected, with an average price of 7.8 Â¢/kWh. Predicted price spikes during the day could rise to 19.4 Â¢, which is the highest estimated price of the week. Wind power production is expected to be below average, contributing to price volatility.

On Tuesday, electricity prices are expected to decrease again, with an average price of 4.4 Â¢/kWh. The lowest price may even dip below zero during the night hours, which is an interesting anomaly in the week's price trends. This may partly explain the price drop on **Tuesday**.

**Wednesday** and **Thursday** are expected to have slightly higher average prices, around 6.8â€“7.8 Â¢/kWh. However, there remains a risk of individual price spikes on both days, particularly during the evening and morning hours. On Friday, prices stabilize slightly, with an average price of 5.9 Â¢/kWh without significant spike risks.
