In the coming week, electricity prices will vary somewhat, but no significant anomalies are expected. **Monday** has the highest price expectations of the week, with the day's maximum price reaching 19.3 cents. This is partly explained by weak wind power, which drops to a minimum of 1019 megawatts during the day. On Tuesday and **Wednesday**, prices are more moderate, but the risk of price spikes remains during individual hours. On Tuesday, high prices are expected in the morning around 8-10 AM, and on Wednesday morning, price spikes may occur between 9-11 AM.

**Thursday** maintains a price level similar to previous days, but there is a risk of price spikes, especially in the evening between 6-8 PM. **Friday** offers slightly cheaper electricity without significant spikes. **Saturday** and **Sunday** stand out as the cheapest days of the week, with Sunday's average price remaining at 2.3 cents and even the highest hourly prices staying below five cents.

Overall, the amount of wind power will vary throughout the week, which partly affects price fluctuations. Higher wind power levels are expected towards the end of the week, which partly explains the more affordable prices over the weekend. The week's weather forecasts appear stable without significant temperature fluctuations.
