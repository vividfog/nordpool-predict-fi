Prices will remain mostly under four cents from **Wednesday** through the weekend, at times even negative. Negative hours will be most likely during the small hours of Wednesday and **Saturday**. Abundant wind power from Wednesday to Saturday will support the low price level. **Sunday** is a public holiday, which may ease demand and keep the average price at 2.5 cents.

The picture will change at the start of next week. **Friday** may see individual hours rise in the morning between 08–10 (the day’s high would fall within this window). Next **Monday** and **Tuesday** stand out for spike risk: Monday’s highest hour is estimated at 17.7 ¢ and Tuesday’s at 23.5 ¢. On Monday the risk hours will concentrate in the evening, 17–19 (there is also an uptick in the morning, 07–09). On Tuesday the spikes will land in the morning, 08–10, and in the afternoon, 16–18. On both days the minimum wind output will be very low (1,114 MW and 766 MW), which explains the higher peaks compared with other days of the week.
