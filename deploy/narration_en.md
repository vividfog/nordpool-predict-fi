The priciest day of the week is expected to be Tuesday, with an average price of 11,7 ¢ and a peak reaching 21,6 ¢. The risk of single-hour spikes will be highlighted especially in the evening at 17:00–19:00. Very low minimum wind output (255 MW) supports the explanation for the higher daily maximum. The lowest prices will fall overnight and early morning, but intraday variation will be large.

On Wednesday, a spike risk for single hours is also projected, especially in the morning at 07:00–09:00, when the day’s top hour would be 13,4 ¢. From Thursday onward, the price level will calm down. Weekend prices will remain low; Sunday will be the cheapest day in the forecast, averaging 3,9 ¢ with a 2,1–6,0 ¢ range. On Saturday, Sunday and next Monday, wind power will be plentiful, which helps explain the clearly lower price levels on these days.
