A tighter price level is forecast for midweek: the averages for **Tuesday**, **Wednesday** and **Thursday** are 11,1, 13,3 and 10,7 ¢. Wednesday is expected to stand out, with a projected maximum of 22,5 ¢ and the peak likely between 08:00–10:00. On Tuesday the top price would be 19,8 ¢ between 17:00–19:00, on Thursday 17,3 ¢ between 15:00–17:00, and **Friday** 14,5 ¢ between 17:00–19:00. The spikes would be explained by weak wind: minimum output stays below 2 000 MW on several days, on Wednesday down to 391 MW.

The most affordable periods will be concentrated at the weekend. **Saturday**’s average price is forecast at 3,6 ¢, and the holiday may weigh on demand and prices; brief morning spikes may occur between 08:00–10:00. **Sunday** looks exceptionally cheap, with an average of 0,3 ¢. Overnight would see negative hours (down to −0,5 ¢), and wind is expected to be plentiful at 3 365–4 906 MW. Monday’s 5,2 ¢ average would sit close to the week’s mid-level.
