The overall picture for the week will be inexpensive: on most days the average price will stay under four cents. Public holidays will show up at the start of the week. **Wednesday**, **Thursday** and **Friday** will be public holidays, which typically dampens demand and supports low prices, especially from Thursday to Saturday. On **Wednesday** the average price is estimated at 6,4 ¢ and the day’s highest hourly price at 11,8 ¢. On the same day wind power’s minimum output will dip unusually low, to 1 410 MW, which explains the higher maximum price.

The clear high point of the week will be **Tuesday** with a 7,8 ¢ average, and the day’s peak reaching 11,1 ¢; the highest levels will cluster around 08–10 and 16–18. The cheapest hours will appear in the small hours of **Friday**, around 01–03, when the price will sink to the 0,5–1,0 ¢ range. Prices on **Sunday** and **Monday** will also remain moderate, with averages at 3,2–3,9 ¢. Overall, abundant wind output from Thursday to Saturday will support low prices, while Tuesday will stand out as the priciest day of the week.
