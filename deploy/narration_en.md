The upcoming week shows a fairly variable price range. **Thursday** stands out as the most affordable day, with an average price of only 0.6 cents per kilowatt-hour, which can be explained by ample wind power production. **Friday**, on the other hand, emerges as the day with the highest average price at 2.6 cents per kilowatt-hour, possibly due to lower wind power production, which can drive prices up.

There is a particular risk of price spikes on **Monday** and **Friday** during specific hours, which could lead to higher electricity prices, especially during peak morning and evening hours. On Monday, the highest price expectations are between 7-9 PM, and on Friday, similar fluctuations might occur during the same time.

The cheapest moments of the week, when prices might even be negative, are expected on Sunday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. These days offer consumers the opportunity to take advantage of lower prices, especially at night and early in the morning.

Overall, the week appears to have a varying price level, and wind power production will significantly impact price development. Next week presents opportunities to benefit from cheaper electricity prices, but also forecasts some more expensive moments.
