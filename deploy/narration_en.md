*Next week's electricity market price expectations vary significantly, with the weekend bringing record low prices, while early in the week prices are set to rise. Wind power production and price spikes influence price developments.*

The upcoming week's electricity market prices appear to be variable. **Thursday** may be relatively inexpensive, with an expected average price of 3.5 Â¢/kWh, but individual hours could reach nearly seven cents. This might be due to the low wind power production, which is the lowest of the day according to the forecast. **Friday**'s prices appear to decrease slightly, with an average price of 2.9 Â¢/kWh. Forecasted price spikes are still possible, which may be due to greater fluctuations in wind power.

The weekend, particularly **Saturday** and **Sunday**, seems to be the most affordable time, with prices remaining very low. On Saturday, the average price is expected to be only 1.6 Â¢/kWh, and even lower on Sunday at 0.7 Â¢/kWh. Sunday's low prices could result from the low wind power production, which is lower on average over the weekend.

**Monday** brings higher prices, with the average price rising to 3.9 Â¢/kWh. This might be due to variations in wind power production. **Tuesday** and **Wednesday** seem to have moderate price levels. Tuesday's average price is expected to be 2.6 Â¢/kWh, and on Wednesday, prices are expected to decrease slightly to 1.9 Â¢/kWh, even though wind power production is forecasted to be stronger.
