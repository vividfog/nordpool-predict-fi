The week's forecast shows significant variation in electricity prices. **Thursday** stands out with the highest average price of 10.6 cents and a maximum price of 21.1 cents. This may be due to the day's lowest wind power production, which remains at 1603 megawatts. **Friday** offers a much more affordable electricity average price of 4.5 cents, with higher average wind power production helping to explain the price drop.

**Saturday** and **Sunday** offer the lowest prices of the week, with average prices falling below one cent on both days. The price expectations for these days are at their lowest, even negative, due to high wind power production. **Monday** brings a slight increase in prices, with the average price at 1.7 cents, but it remains quite affordable.

**Tuesday's** average price rises slightly to 2.6 cents, but stays reasonable. **Wednesday**, on the other hand, brings the possibility of price spikes, with the maximum price rising to 11.7 cents. This day stands out from the others in terms of price fluctuations, with potential spikes expected especially during the evening hours.
