*Electricity prices will vary significantly in the coming week, as price spikes on Tuesday and especially on Wednesday drive up average prices, while weekend days offer more affordable rates and even potential negative figures.*

Due to maintenance outages at nuclear power plants, Loviisa 1 has a nominal capacity of 496 MW, but currently has zero MW available. The maintenance outage began on 6 September 2025 at 10:00 and is expected to end on 2 October 2025 at 12:00. The maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as training data from periods of maintenance outages is limited.

Electricity prices are expected to vary significantly between days in the coming week. **Wednesday** stands out with its high average price, expected to be 12 ¢/kWh, with the day's highest price potentially reaching 24.6 ¢. This may be related to the low minimum wind power production, forecasted to be only 866 MW, which could partly explain the higher prices.

**Tuesday** is also expected to have a risk of price spikes, with the day's highest price potentially rising to 21.8 ¢/kWh. The expected average price on Tuesday is 7.8 ¢/kWh, which is moderately high, although wind power is expected to be at a normal level.

Weekend days, such as **Saturday** and **Sunday**, are predicted to be more affordable, with their average prices remaining low, around 1 ¢/kWh. On Sunday, prices could momentarily drop to negative figures, which is rare but possible at night when demand is at its lowest.

On **Monday**, prices will rise again, with an average price of 5.6 ¢/kWh. Although wind power production is slightly higher compared to Wednesday, price spikes are still anticipated, with the maximum price potentially reaching 12.9 ¢/kWh.
