The coming week brings varying electricity prices. **Sunday** starts the week with relatively moderate prices, with an average price of 3.1 ¢/kWh. There is significant fluctuation between the minimum and maximum prices, and the risk of price spikes is present, especially in the morning. Wind power production varies considerably on Sunday, potentially explaining the price fluctuations.

**Monday** and **Tuesday** seem to be slightly more expensive days, with average prices of 4.6 ¢/kWh and 5.2 ¢/kWh. On these days, price spikes may occur in the morning and evening hours. On Monday, wind power production is higher on average, but on Tuesday, it is lower, which might contribute to the increase in prices.

Midweek, on **Wednesday**, price expectations rise to 5.9 ¢/kWh, with daily maximum prices possibly reaching up to 9.8 ¢/kWh. This day stands out with its higher average price and wind power production being slightly below average. Wind power production peaks in the afternoon, but price increases might still occur.

**Thursday** and **Friday** prices settle slightly above five cents. During these days, wind power production varies fairly evenly, but the risk of price spikes remains. Friday's price forecast shows the highest maximum price, 9.3 ¢/kWh, which might cause surprises during the afternoon and evening hours.

The week ends with **Saturday**, whose average price is 3.6 ¢/kWh. This day offers lower prices compared to other days of the week, and wind power production is at a high level, which may help reduce prices.

*Looking ahead to the coming week with gpt-4o.* 🌬️
