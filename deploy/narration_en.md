Average prices over the next few days will largely remain at an expensive or very expensive level. The cheapest period is expected to be the weekend, as **Saturday** and **Sunday** will see daily averages of about 10–11 cents and the range will stay below 14 cents. The highest weekly averages are expected on **Thursday** and next **Tuesday**, when the average will hover around 21 cents.

The single highest price spike is forecast for next **Tuesday**, when the maximum will reach 45.6 cents. On the same day, the minimum wind-power level will fall to 764 megawatts, and this low minimum output will also show up as an unusually high peak hour. The risk of price spikes is high on **Thursday** and **Friday**, and the most expensive hours in the forecast for both days will fall in the evening around 17:00–19:00. The risk of price spikes will also be high next **Monday**, **Tuesday**, and **Wednesday**.
