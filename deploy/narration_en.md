Clearly varying price levels are expected for the week. On **Thursday**, the average price is expected to drop to 7.9 cents, and the day’s lowest expectation is 3.4¢. By daily average, the week’s most expensive day is expected to be **Tuesday** (15.3¢), with a peak reaching 21.0 cents. On **Monday**, the average price is expected to be 14.4 cents and the maximum 20.4 cents, so the start of the week is expected to be very expensive overall.

A public holiday falls on **Tuesday**, and demand is expected to be lower than normal, which may push the price down. The risk of price spikes is emphasized on **Sunday** from 18:00 to 20:00, when the hourly price is highest in the forecast (peak at 19:00). A similar risk is expected on **Monday** from 08:00 to 10:00 (peak at 09:00), **Tuesday** from 17:00 to 19:00 (peak at 18:00), and **Wednesday** from 08:00 to 10:00 (peak at 09:00). Toward the end of the week, the price level is expected to settle clearly lower, and on **Saturday** an average price of 8.9 cents is expected.
