The week's electricity price trends forecast significant variations across the days. **Friday** stands out as the most expensive day of the week, with an average price of 15.2 ¬¢. This is particularly influenced by the low wind power production, averaging only 355 megawatts. On Friday, price spikes may occur during morning and evening hours, with prices potentially reaching up to 29.1 ¬¢.

The cheapest days of the week are **Sunday** and **Saturday**, with average prices below 2.2 ¬¢. On these days, there is ample wind power available, which explains the low prices. However, on Saturday, there is a risk of price spikes during individual hours, particularly in the morning.

**On Monday**, electricity prices begin to rise slightly but remain reasonable at 3.7 ¬¢. Wind power production is high during this time, supporting moderate price trends. **Tuesday** and **Wednesday** see prices stabilizing again at a higher level, especially on Tuesday, where the risk of price spikes is significant.

For nuclear power plants, Loviisa 1 and 2 are under maintenance, which may affect the accuracy of the forecast, as training data from maintenance periods is limited. The maintenance started on 6.9.2025 and 17.8.2025, and is expected to end on 24.9.2025 and 17.9.2025.
