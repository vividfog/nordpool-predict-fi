Next week's electricity prices will vary considerably across different days. **On Saturday**, prices will remain low, with an average price of just 0.1 cents.

Wind power production remains high.

**On Monday**, the average price will increase to over four cents, indicating a steady rise in prices at the beginning of the week. On Tuesday, prices will rise significantly, with the average price reaching a high of 11.2 cents, which is a notable change compared to the affordable prices earlier in the week. The low average wind power production and high price spikes affect the price trends.

Throughout the week, price trends vary, with Tuesday's high prices standing out. This is partly due to low wind power production, which affects the rise in prices. Other days of the week offer reasonable prices, and wind power production is generally normal.
