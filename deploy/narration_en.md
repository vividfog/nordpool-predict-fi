**Sunday** sees much more moderate price expectations, with an average price of just 3.1 ¢/kWh. Wind power production is expected to be abundant, contributing to lower prices.

At the start of the week, **Monday**, electricity prices are forecasted to be low at 2.2 ¢/kWh, with strong wind power production contributing to the moderate prices.

**Tuesday** and **Wednesday** show a slight increase in prices, with average prices at 5.1 ¢/kWh and 7.1 ¢/kWh. Tuesday presents a risk of price spikes in the evening, and Wednesday is also expected to see spikes, particularly in the afternoon and evening hours.

Later in the week, **Thursday** sees prices drop again to a reasonable level of 3.3 ¢/kWh, with abundant wind power production expected, aiding in keeping prices moderate.
