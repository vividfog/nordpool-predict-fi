At the start of the week, average prices are expected to be on the pricey side, around 13,9–14,4 ¢. Individual high hours are anticipated for Monday evening and especially Tuesday morning, when the day’s maximum is estimated at 23,1 ¢. From Thursday onward, the level would fall clearly, and the week’s lowest averages would be seen Friday–Sunday, mostly under four cents.

Spike risk for individual hours will be highlighted especially on **Tuesday** morning around 8–10. Tuesday’s high maximum is explained by an exceptionally low wind power minimum (660 MW) combined with the morning peak. On **Wednesday**, spike risk would also appear in the morning around 8–10, even though the level would remain somewhat lower than on Tuesday. Low prices later in the week would be explained by abundant wind power, strengthening from Thursday and remaining strong through the weekend.
