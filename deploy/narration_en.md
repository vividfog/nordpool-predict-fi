The week is expected to split clearly in two: the beginning will be very expensive, and the latter part of the week will drop markedly. On **Tuesday**, the expected average price rises to the highest level, 19.4¢, and the daily peak reaches 33.3 cents. The highest hourly price in the forecast falls between 08:00 and 10:00, and the day is explicitly assessed as having a high risk of individual price spikes. On **Monday**, the average price is set at 18.5 cents, and the maximum is forecast at 32.1¢. The peak occurs between 07:00 and 09:00, and the risk of price spikes is high.

On Wednesday, the average price drops to 13.9 cents, but the day is still flagged for a high price-spike risk, and the highest hours fall between 09:00 and 11:00 (maximum 20.8¢). On Thursday, the average price falls to 7.3 cents, and a risk of price spikes in individual hours is noted. Toward the end of the week, the forecast sinks to its lowest levels, with Friday’s average at 5.2¢ and the day’s lowest hourly price at 1.8 cents.
