Price expectations for the week will mostly sit at a high level, especially early in the week. The most pronounced will be **Tuesday**, with an average price of 13,5 ¢ and a forecast peak of 21,3 ¢. The high peak is explained by an exceptionally low minimum wind output (258 MW), well below 2 000 MW. For **Friday**, the peak is also estimated at 20,2 ¢. The risk of price spikes will be flagged for each day: on Tuesday the evening around 6–8 pm will stand out, whereas on **Monday** and **Wednesday** spikes will concentrate in the morning around 8–10 am.

The cheapest hours will cluster at night. At the start of **Sunday**, the price is expected to be 0,6 ¢ (midnight–2 am), and in the early morning of **Friday** around 3–4 ¢ (2–4 am). In midweek, individual high periods will also appear in the afternoon and early evening: on **Thursday** 5–7 pm up to 15,9 ¢, on **Friday** 6–8 pm around 20 ¢, and on **Saturday** 4–6 pm up to 12,7 ¢. On **Sunday**, the peak will fall in the early evening 4–6 pm, but the daily average will remain clearly lower than on other days.
