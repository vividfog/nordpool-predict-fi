*Electricity prices for the upcoming week will vary significantly, especially over the weekend when the risk of price spikes increases due to low wind power production. Prices will remain low at the start of the week but rise towards the weekend.*

Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is undergoing maintenance starting from September 20th and is expected to continue until October 10th. Loviisa 1 plant is also under maintenance starting from September 6th, with an expected end on September 29th. The maintenance may affect the accuracy of the forecast as training data during maintenance periods is limited.

Electricity price forecasts for the upcoming week show variability. **On Tuesday**, the expected average price is low, only 1.5 cents per kilowatt-hour, with prices potentially dropping to negative during nighttime hours. **Wednesday** and **Thursday** follow as moderate days with prices below five cents.

**Friday** sees a slight increase in prices, with a risk of price spikes. **Saturday** is forecasted to have the highest prices of the week, with an average of 15.8 ¬¢/kWh, and price spikes may occur, particularly during morning and evening hours due to low wind power production. **Sunday** remains at a high price level, with a significant risk of spikes.

The week concludes with next **Monday**, where the average price is forecasted to be 13.5 cents per kilowatt-hour, with maximum prices reaching up to 35.6 ¬¢, making it the most expensive day of the week. This is partly due to low wind power production and ongoing nuclear plant maintenance, which limits energy production.
