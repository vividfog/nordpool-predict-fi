|:-------------|:----------------:|:----------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| **Saturday** | 6,6 | 1,3 - 11,5 | 156 - 2201 | 4,5 |
| **Sunday** | 0,9 | -0,5 - 2,8 | 2529 - 5426 | 4,7 |
| **Monday** | 5,8 | 1,0 - 11,7 | 1080 - 3758 | 4,1 |
| **Tuesday** | 1,2 | 0,4 - 2,4 | 3252 - 4662 | 5,0 |
| **Wednesday** | 1,1 | -0,3 - 2,5 | 3815 - 5198 | 6,9 |
| **Thursday** | 6,1 | -0,4 - 21,1 | 769 - 5401 | 7,1 |
| **Friday** | 1,1 | -0,1 - 2,2 | 1589 - 4913 | 6,6 |

The weekly picture will lean largely toward very low days. On **Sunday** the average price will settle at 0,9 ¢ and will likely stay under two cents for many hours, at times even negative. On **Tuesday**, **Wednesday** and **Friday** the level will likewise hover near one cent, with occasional negative hours possible. **Saturday** will be a public holiday; its average price will be 6,6 ¢. On **Monday** the average will be 5,8 ¢, but a spike risk will appear toward the evening around 16–18, when hourly prices could climb clearly above the daily average.

The clearest exception will be **Thursday**. The day’s maximum will reach 21,1 ¢ according to the forecast, with the peak occurring in the evening around 16–18. The unusually high maximum will be explained by a very low minimum in wind generation (769 MW) that day. Conversely, abundant wind will keep prices in check on several other days, especially on Sunday and Wednesday. The cheapest hours will typically fall at night and in the early morning, when prices may dip below zero.
