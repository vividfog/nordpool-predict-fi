The upcoming week will bring fluctuating price trends. **On Sunday**, electricity price expectations vary significantly, starting from negative prices and rising to 14 cents. The average price for the day is forecasted at 3.8 ¢. This is due to low wind power production, which is at its lowest at only 563 MW. **Thursday** is expected to show similar characteristics, with the average price rising to 4 ¢, and there is a risk of price spikes. Wind power is also scarce, affecting the price trends.

In contrast, the beginning of the week offers more affordable electricity prices. **On Monday**, the average price is predicted to be just 1 ¢, with ample wind power keeping prices low. **On Tuesday**, prices are expected to be slightly higher but still below 1.5 cents on average. **On Friday**, the price level remains moderate, with an average price of 1.3 ¢.

**On Saturday**, prices remain low, although daily price fluctuations are significant. The average electricity price stays at 1.5 ¢. Throughout the week, temperatures range from 10.7 °C to 14.6 °C, which does not significantly impact prices.
