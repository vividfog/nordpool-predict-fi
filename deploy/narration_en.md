The week’s price path is expected to be variable. The lowest average price, 2,8 ¢, is expected to fall on **Sunday**. After that the level will rise to 6,9 ¢ on **Monday** and peak at 11,2 ¢ on **Tuesday**, with a projected maximum of 18,2 ¢. **Wednesday** and **Thursday** will settle around 5,8 ¢. **Friday** is seen at 7,6 ¢ and **Saturday** at 5,3 ¢. **Sunday’s** low level would appear supported by ample wind power (average 4 982 MW).

The risk of price spikes is emphasized on **Tuesday** and **Friday**. **Tuesday’s** peak would fall around 16:00–18:00. The high maximum price is linked to an exceptionally low minimum wind output of 1 294 MW, clearly below 2 000 MW. **Friday’s** single peak will likely occur in the evening at 19:00–21:00, when the hourly price reaches 13,9 ¢ in the forecast. The week’s cheapest hours will concentrate in the early hours of **Sunday**, around 03:00–05:00, when the price falls below two cents. On **Tuesday**, the daily average wind output remains at 1 859 MW, the week’s lowest, which explains the markedly higher price level that day. On other days, intraday variation will remain calmer than on Tuesday.
