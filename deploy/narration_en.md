| **Tuesday** | 15.9 | 6.0 - 27.0 | 480 - 1707 | 6.4 |

| **Sunday** | 3.1 | 1.7 - 4.1 | 2783 - 5145 | 4.7 |

The overall picture for the week will look inexpensive: from Thursday onward, average prices will stay broadly below five cents. Clearly higher levels will be seen early in the week, when **Tuesday** and **Wednesday** averages would be 15.9 Â¢ and 10.4 Â¢. The priciest individual hours will fall on Tuesday, whereas the weekâ€™s cheapest moments will be concentrated in the early hours of Thursday.

**On Tuesday** the price peaks will cluster into two periods. The dayâ€™s highest price, 27.0 Â¢, would fall around 10:00â€“12:00. Another clearly expensive window would form in the evening around 19:00â€“21:00, when prices would again rise well above 20 Â¢. Intraday variation would be unusually large: minimum wind output would be only 480 MW, which helps explain the weekâ€™s highest peak on that day.

**On Wednesday** prices in the morning hours would be elevated, and the dayâ€™s peak, 22.5 Â¢, would likely occur around 08:00â€“10:00. Wind would remain weak especially in the early hours, supporting higher morning prices. The dayâ€™s low would be 1.7 Â¢ late in the evening. The risk of hourly spikes would be pronounced, particularly in the morning.

**From Thursday** onward the price level would drop markedly. The whole day would run between zero and 2.6 Â¢, and the cheapest moments would fall in the early morning around 03:00â€“05:00, when the minimum would be 0.0 Â¢. Strong wind generation would also push prices down from **Friday** to **Monday**, keeping averages low and the range confined to single-digit cents. Weekend levels would be moderate, and after the early week the market would shift broadly to inexpensive readings.
