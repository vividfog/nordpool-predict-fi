The coming week is expected to bring varying electricity prices, with potential price spikes on **Tuesday** and next **Monday**. The average price on **Tuesday** is expected to be 8.5 ¢/kWh, but prices may fluctuate significantly throughout the day, with the highest predicted price reaching 18.2 ¢/kWh. This is partly due to low wind power production, dropping even below 1000 MW during the day.

On **Wednesday**, the lowest prices of the week are anticipated, averaging 4.4 ¢/kWh, due to strong wind power exceeding the 3000 MW level at times. This provides significant relief for households and businesses.

Prices on **Thursday** and **Friday** remain moderate, but price spikes are expected on both days. **Thursday's** average price is 6.5 ¢/kWh, rising slightly to 6.7 ¢/kWh on **Friday**. On both days, wind power production remains below 2500 MW, which may elevate individual prices.

The price level on **Saturday** remains steady at 6.6 ¢/kWh, but prices could rise again on **Sunday**. The average price on **Sunday** would be 7.0 ¢/kWh, and the highest hourly prices could exceed 15 ¢/kWh. This is due to weak wind power, dropping below 1000 MW.

Next **Monday** stands out as the most expensive day of the week, with an average price of 13.4 ¢/kWh. This is due to both low wind power and a predicted price spike, potentially raising prices to 26.3 ¢/kWh.
