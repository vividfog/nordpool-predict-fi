Next week, the electricity prices are expected to show variable trends. **Sunday** and **Monday** are anticipated to be more affordable days, with average prices at 0.5 and 4.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. Wind power production will be significantly higher on these days, which helps keep the prices in check.

On **Tuesday**, a significantly higher average price of 11.3 cents per kilowatt-hour is expected, possibly due to lower wind power production. The day's maximum price could rise to as much as 19.6 cents, with a risk of price spikes, especially during morning and evening hours. The minimum wind power output is just 1228 MW, explaining the price increase.

From the middle of the week onwards, prices are expected to stabilize again. On **Wednesday**, the average price will be 5.8 cents, and wind power production will slightly increase, contributing to moderate prices. On **Thursday** and **Friday**, prices remain affordable, with average prices at 3.0 and 3.4 cents per kilowatt-hour. Wind power production is expected to be typical on these days.

Over the weekend, on **Saturday**, prices are expected to rise again slightly, with an average price of 6.8 cents per kilowatt-hour. Wind power production will fall below the usual level, which might explain the price increase. There is a potential risk of price spikes during certain hours.
