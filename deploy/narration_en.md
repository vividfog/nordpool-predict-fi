*Electricity prices will fluctuate significantly in the coming days. Thursday is expected to see the highest average prices, while on Sunday, prices will remain low due to more abundant wind power. The risk of price spikes is particularly notable on Thursday and Tuesday, when demand and supply fluctuate most strongly.*

Electricity prices will vary in the coming days, but no major changes are expected. **Thursday**'s average price rises to the highest of the week, at 6.2 cents. This is partly due to low wind power production, fluctuating between 491 megawatts and 1821 megawatts. Thursday also has a high risk of price spikes, particularly during the morning and evening, when electricity demand is at its peak. Prices could then exceed the predicted maximum.

The most affordable day of the week is **Sunday**, with an average price of 0.8 cents. This is partly due to abundant wind power, which remains at a high level on average. On Sunday, the minimum price may even drop slightly below zero, but the risk of price spikes is minimal. This calms the markets for Sunday.

**Friday** and **Saturday** offer moderate prices, at 4.5 and 2.1 cents, but individual price spikes are possible. On Friday and Saturday, wind power production is variable, which could lead to price increases at certain hours.

**Monday** and **Tuesday** have moderate prices, with average prices at 2.8 and 3.1 cents. On Monday, wind power production is generally high, helping to keep prices low. On Tuesday, there is again a possibility of price spikes, especially during the afternoon hours.
