On Saturday, the highest average price of the week is expected, at 5.0 ¢/kWh, with a significant price fluctuation throughout the day, ranging from 0.7 ¢ to as high as 13.0 ¢. This is partly due to the low minimum wind power production. There is also a high risk of price spikes on Saturday, particularly between 5 PM and 7 PM. On Sunday, price expectations are more moderate, with an average price of 3.2 ¢/kWh, but price spikes may still occur at individual hours.

Monday stands out with its highest maximum price of 15.6 ¢/kWh, and the same day's average price rises to 6.3 ¢/kWh. This can partly be attributed to low minimum wind power production. On Tuesday, the average price is expected to drop to 4.6 ¢/kWh, but price spikes may still occur.

Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday are predicted to be steady and more affordable days. The average prices for Wednesday and Thursday are 2.3 ¢/kWh and 2.1 ¢/kWh, and on Friday, the price is expected to be 2.0 ¢/kWh. There is no significant risk of price spikes on these days, and the price level remains stable.
