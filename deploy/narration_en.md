This high price level may be due to the low minimum wind power production, forecasted at 1338 MW. Thursday stands out with potential price spikes, where the highest hourly prices could rise to 12.7 ¢/kWh.

**Friday** and **Saturday** are expected to offer more affordable prices, with average prices remaining at the 3.4 ¢/kWh level. Saturday's wind power production is low, but it does not seem to significantly impact the price. **Monday** continues the trend of affordability with an average price of 3.2 ¢/kWh, and wind power production is at a typical level.

The cheapest moments of the week occur on **Wednesday**, when prices could drop to as low as 0.2 ¢/kWh. This day also stands out with high wind power production, which might help lower prices. **Sunday** sees prices staying reasonable, with a maximum price expected to be 6.8 ¢/kWh.

Overall, next week is expected to have relatively moderate price trends, except for the potential higher prices on Tuesday. No significant deviations are expected in wind power production, so its effect on prices remains stable.
