*Electricity prices for the upcoming week will vary significantly, especially due to the anticipated price spikes on Wednesday, while Sunday offers the lowest prices of the week. Variations in wind power production partly explain the fluctuations in prices.*

The electricity prices for the coming week show variability, with **Wednesday** standing out with the highest average price of 11.0 ¬¢/kWh. On this day, the maximum price could rise to 21.2 ¬¢/kWh, making it the most expensive day of the week. The low wind power production, particularly the minimum production falling below 2000 MW, may partly explain the high maximum price.

**Thursday** sees an average electricity price of 5.0 ¬¢/kWh, which is more moderate than Wednesday, but the risk of price spikes still exists. Individual hours, such as 9 AM, may bring higher prices, making Thursday a variable day in terms of prices.

On **Friday** and **Saturday**, price expectations are lower, at 2.5 and 2.0 ¬¢/kWh, with no risk of price spikes on these days. **Sunday** sees the lowest prices of the week, with an average price of only 1.0 ¬¢/kWh, and minimum prices are even expected to be negative during some hours.

**Monday** sees prices rise slightly from previous days but remain at a reasonable level of 2.2 ¬¢/kWh. Thus, the beginning and end of the week are more affordable times for electricity consumption.

The entire week shows price variability, and particularly on **Wednesday**, the risk of price spikes is notable, so consumers should be aware of possible high prices. *Prices interpreted by gpt-4o.* üå¨Ô∏è
