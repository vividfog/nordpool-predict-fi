Next **Saturday**, electricity market prices are expected to vary widely, starting from even negative prices and rising up to 11 cents. However, the average price remains moderate, around 2.3 cents. Wind power production is expected to be variable, which may partly explain the price fluctuation.

On **Sunday**, there is a risk of price spikes, especially during the morning and evening hours when prices can rise significantly. The high variability in wind power production and lower average temperatures may affect this. Nonetheless, the average price stays low at about 2.0 cents.

Next **Monday**, the price trend is similar to Sunday, and the risk of price spikes continues. The average price is expected to be slightly higher, at 2.4 cents. Wind power production is slightly more stable, but variability is still evident.

**Tuesday** sees more moderate price fluctuations compared to the weekend, and significant price spikes are not anticipated. The average price rises slightly to 2.7 cents but remains low. Wind power production is at an average level, which partly stabilizes prices.

On **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, there is again a risk of price spikes, with the average price rising to 4.1 cents. This is clearly higher than in previous days. Particularly Wednesday evening may be expensive, with a maximum price reaching 8.9 cents. Low wind power production may partly explain the higher prices on these days.

On **Friday**, the average price drops slightly to 3.8 cents, but the risk of price spikes remains. Wind power production is relatively low, which could drive prices up in the evening.
