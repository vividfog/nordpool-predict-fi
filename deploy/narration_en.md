The upcoming week will see significant fluctuations in electricity prices in Finland. **Wednesday** is expected to have the highest average price of the week at 7.7 ¢/kWh, with the maximum daily price potentially reaching up to 20.1 ¢. This is partly explained by low wind power production, averaging only 1212 MW. **Thursday** and **Friday** will feature significantly lower prices, with average prices at 0.5 ¢ and 0.9 ¢, respectively. On these days, wind power is considerably higher, supporting the lower prices.

On **Saturday** and **Sunday**, there may be isolated price spikes, even though average prices remain low at 0.9 ¢ and 1.5 ¢. The combination of low minimum wind power production and higher maximum prices on Saturday and Sunday could lead to spikes during morning or evening hours. **Monday** and **Tuesday** will again see low electricity prices, with average prices at 1.3 ¢ and 0.8 ¢. Tuesday's strong wind power production supports the low price level.

Throughout the week, electricity prices remain generally affordable, but **Wednesday's** high prices stand out clearly. Over the weekend, the risk of price spikes is emphasized, particularly during morning and evening hours.
