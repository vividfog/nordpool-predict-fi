*The early week will be clearly more expensive with peak risks, but Thursdayâ€™s very low prices will start a multi-day cheap spell; the weekend will remain moderate and even.*

Clear differences between days are expected this week. **On Tuesday** the average price will rise to 16,6 Â¢, with single hours peaking at 28,1 Â¢. Notably, the exceptionally low minimum wind output (489 MW) explains the pronounced peak price. Peak risk would fall in the late morning 09:00â€“11:00 and in the evening 18:00â€“20:00, when hourly prices climb clearly above the daily average.

**On Wednesday** the average will settle at 10,1 Â¢, with peaks up to 22,1 Â¢. The dayâ€™s minimum wind will drop to 812 MW, which is below 2000 MW and is linked to the higher hourly prices. Peak risk would concentrate in the morning hours 08:00â€“10:00. Intraday dispersion will be large: in the late evening 21:00â€“23:00 the price level will fall to 4,0â€“1,8 Â¢ as wind strengthens.

**On Thursday** prices are expected to be very low throughout the day (0,3â€“2,9 Â¢; avg 1,7 Â¢). Strong wind, averaging 4416 MW and peaking above 5 GW, will push prices down. **Friday** and **Saturday** will remain moderate (avg 5,0â€“5,8 Â¢), and intraday swings will be limited.

**On Sunday** the average would remain at 3,4 Â¢ and **next Monday** at 4,7 Â¢. On both days, wind power is expected to be plentiful (avg over 3,5 GW on Sunday and over 4,1 GW on Monday), supporting a low price level. Individual prices dipping near zero are not anticipated; near-zero levels are reached only on Thursday, when the full-day range would remain below 3 Â¢.

Overall the week will split: two clearly more expensive days at the start, followed by several cheaper days. The cheapest hours will fall on Thursday, while the highest prices will cluster in Tuesdayâ€™s late morning and evening and on Wednesday morning. If the wind trajectory deviates from the forecast, single-hour peaks could still shift, especially on Tuesday and Wednesday.
