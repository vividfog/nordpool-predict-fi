Electricity prices over the coming days will be uneven, with notable fluctuations especially during the weekend.

On **Friday**, the average electricity price will remain slightly below eight cents. However, significant variability is expected on **Saturday**, as hourly prices range from as low as 0,8 cents to over 20 cents per kilowatt-hour. Saturday‚Äôs highest prices, exceeding 15 cents, will occur in the morning approximately between 8‚Äì10 am. During this period, the risk of price spikes is substantial, and actual peak prices could exceed the forecast.

The price fluctuations on Saturday are primarily due to significant variability in wind power production. Wind production will momentarily drop to very low levels, even below 100 MW, which explains the high price peaks observed in the morning hours. Wind generation will increase considerably by evening, bringing prices back down to lower levels.

**Sunday** will stand out as the week's cheapest day. Throughout the entire day, electricity prices will remain negative, averaging around -0,9 cents. This exceptionally low price level can be attributed to very high wind power generation, which will consistently remain above 2000 megawatts throughout the day and even surpass 5000 megawatts in the afternoon. Thus, Sunday will offer consumers especially affordable electricity throughout the day.

At the beginning of next week, electricity prices will remain moderate. After Sunday‚Äôs lowest weekly prices, rates will rise slightly but remain very inexpensive. On **Monday** and Tuesday, average prices will be around one cent, with occasionally negative hourly prices. However, the risk for price spikes will persist on both days, although less pronounced compared to Saturday.

Forecasts for Wednesday and Thursday will be very similar. Average electricity prices will stay below two cents, with a narrow variation range, peaking just below four cents. Nevertheless, the risk for price spikes will continue during these days as well.
