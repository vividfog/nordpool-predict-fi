| **Thursday** | 1,2 | -0,0 - 2,9 | 3185 - 6494 | 1,4 |
| **Friday** | 1,9 | -0,4 - 3,9 | 2758 - 6500 | 2,2 |
| **Saturday** | 1,0 | -0,5 - 2,0 | 4001 - 5471 | 1,1 |

| **Monday** | 5,2 | 2,3 - 10,2 | 1698 - 3927 | -0,5 |
| **Tuesday** | 8,9 | 3,3 - 14,3 | 1555 - 3774 | -1,1 |

The start of the week will look inexpensive. **Thursday**, **Friday** and **Saturday** averages will stay around 1–2 cents, and some night hours would even dip negative. **Sunday** would remain under four cents on average, but the day’s high would reach 10,0 ¢. Low prices from Thursday to Saturday would be explained by abundant wind power, which would stay clearly above 3000 MW during most hours.

Later in the week the price level would tighten. **Monday**’s average would rise to 5,2 ¢. **Tuesday** would climb to 8,9 ¢ and **Wednesday** to 12,0 ¢. Tuesday carries a risk of individual price spikes; based on the hourly forecast, the daily peak would fall around 16:00–18:00 and reach about 14,3 ¢. Wednesday has a high spike risk; the highest hour would occur around 17:00–19:00 and rise to an estimated 19,2 ¢. Weak wind would explain these peaks: on both days the minimum wind output would fall below 2000 MW, which typically lifts individual hourly prices.
