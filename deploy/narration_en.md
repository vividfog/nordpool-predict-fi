| **Thursday** | 10,2 | 3,3 - 21,8 | 792 - 1921 | 4,8 |
| **Friday** | 5,6 | 0,8 - 11,0 | 1339 - 3578 | 4,3 |

Clear variation is expected in the weekâ€™s price trend. **On Sunday**, the average price will remain around 1,3 cents, and the pre-dawn hours will likely see even negative prices. Strong wind will weigh on the price level throughout the day. **On Monday**, the level will rise but still remain under a five-cent average.

Overall, the weekâ€™s highest average price will fall on **Wednesday** (11,9 Â¢), and high maximum prices are also forecast for **Tuesday** and **Thursday**. On these days, minimum wind output will drop exceptionally low, in places clearly below 1000 MW, which explains the markedly higher peak prices. **On Tuesday**, spike risk will be pronounced in the early evening, most likely around 17:00â€“19:00, when the maximum is forecast at 23,6 Â¢. **On Wednesday**, a similar peak will occur in the evening, roughly 17:00â€“19:00, with the upper bound at 22,4 Â¢. **On Thursday**, upward pressure is expected in the late afternoon and early evening, around 16:00â€“18:00, with a maximum forecast of 21,8 Â¢.

Later in the week the pressure will ease. **Fridayâ€™s** average will be about 5,6 cents. There will still be a risk of single-hour spikes in the evening, most likely 17:00â€“19:00, with the peak around 11,0 cents. **Saturday** is a public holiday, which could soften demand and temper prices for part of the day. At the same time, wind minima will remain very low, so single-hour spike risk will stay elevated, especially in the early evening, roughly 16:00â€“18:00, with an upper bound of 16,7 Â¢.

In summary, the early week will look affordable, midweek expensive, and the weekend moderate. The clearest outliers of the week are the Tuesday and Wednesday evening spikes, which rise above the 20-cent mark. Conversely, the cheapest hours of the week will fall in the pre-dawn of Sunday, when prices dip below zero.
