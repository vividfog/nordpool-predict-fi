On Tuesday and Wednesday, electricity prices will experience fluctuations, with prices expected to rise significantly during specific hours. On **Tuesday**, the average price remains moderate at 4,9 cents, but the highest prices occur roughly between 19:00 and 21:00, reaching close to 15 cents. **Wednesday**, in turn, is expected to have the week's highest average price at 8,4 cents. The day's highest price period will be between 08:00 and 10:00, exceeding 17 cents per kilowatt-hour.

The most affordable day of the week will be **Friday**, when the average electricity price is forecasted to be only 2 cents. Price fluctuations on Friday are minimal, and even at peak times, prices remain below four cents. The cheapest moments will occur early Friday morning between 04:00 and 05:00, when prices approach almost zero.

On **Thursday** and **Saturday**, prices will vary moderately but will remain significantly lower than on Wednesday. Thursday's most expensive hours occur in the morning between 09:00 and 11:00, with prices exceeding 11 cents. On Saturday, price variation will be especially noticeable in the evening between 19:00 and 21:00, when prices rise above 10 cents.

On **Sunday** and next **Monday**, the prices will be quite stable overall, with peak prices lower compared to the start of the week. Sunday's highest prices will occur in the evening between 20:00 and 22:00, nearing nine cents. Next Monday's peak price occurs around eight in the morning, slightly above eight cents.

The weekly price forecast clearly shows the influence of wind power production. Wednesday's high average price of 8,4 cents is partly explained by exceptionally low wind power generation, averaging below 600 megawatts for the day. On Wednesday, wind power production is at a minimum of only 198 MW, increasing the risk of price spikes. On other days of the week, low wind power levels can momentarily raise prices, but the impact remains moderate.
