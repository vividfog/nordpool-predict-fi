Prices over the week will split clearly: the weekend and Friday will be affordable, whereas the early week will rise to higher levels. The most notable day will be **Monday**, with an average price of 10,1 ¢ and a forecast peak of 16,5 ¢. Weak wind explains the level: minimum wind generation will drop to 1037 MW and the day’s high will be the week’s highest. Short-lived spikes will most likely cluster around 10:00–12:00 and 17:00–19:00.

On **Tuesday**, the level will remain high, with an average of 9,5 ¢. Brief spikes will most likely occur in the morning around 9:00–11:00 and early evening 17:00–19:00. **Wednesday**, **Thursday** and **Friday** are public holidays, which may reduce demand and show as a softer price trend: averages will range from 7,3 to 2,0 ¢, and the week’s low will be on Friday (avg 2,0 ¢). The weekend will stay moderate: Saturday’s and Sunday’s averages will be 2,1 ¢ and 3,5 ¢.
