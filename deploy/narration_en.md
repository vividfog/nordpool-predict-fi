Clear differences are expected for the week. **Thursday** the average price is expected to settle at 1,5 ¢, and at night prices will briefly dip negative, down to -0,4 ¢. Strong wind (avg 4883 MW) will support the unusually low level. **Sunday** will average 3,2 ¢ with plentiful wind (avg 4315 MW), keeping prices clearly low. The highest average of the week is expected on **Wednesday**, at 9,7 ¢.

**Wednesday** the daily maximum will rise to 20,5 ¢. The risk of spikes in individual hours will be elevated, and the peak may land between 8–10. Wind power is expected to bottom out at 821 MW, which together with a low average output (2189 MW) helps explain the high peak. In the evening prices will drop markedly, down to 0,5–1,6 ¢ between 21–23, so intraday variation will be large.

**Friday** will average 6,6 ¢ and spike risk will be present; the daily high of 13,5 ¢ will most likely fall between 7–9. Weak wind (avg 2425 MW, min 1435 MW) may support the costlier morning hours. **Saturday** will have the same 6,6 ¢ average, and a single spike, up to 10,9 ¢, may occur between 8–10. Wind will remain rather weak (avg 2380 MW), with a minimum at 1439 MW.

**Tuesday** the average will rise to 8,5 ¢ and spike risk will be pronounced. The daily maximum is forecast at 15,4 ¢, potentially between 8–10. Wind output is expected to drop to as low as 768 MW, which explains the higher peak compared to other days. Elevated levels of about 13–14 ¢ will also be seen in the early evening, around 18–20. At other times during the week, prices will mostly stay below ten cents, and the cheapest hours will occur around the night-to-morning transition on Thursday.
