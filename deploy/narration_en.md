*Electricity prices in Finland will fluctuate over the coming week, but will mostly remain moderate. However, individual price spikes may occur, especially during low wind power production, temporarily increasing electricity costs.*

The electricity price forecast was updated on Friday at 12:06. The following are the forecasts by weekday:

|         | average<br>price<br>¬¢/kWh | min - max<br>¬¢/kWh | wind power<br>min - max<br>MW | average<br>temperature<br>¬∞C |
|:--------|:----------------:|:----------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| **Saturday**  | 3.2 | 0.6 - 7.3 | 356 - 1950 | 16.8 |
| **Sunday** | 3.0 | 1.6 - 6.2 | 162 - 1258 | 17.3 |
| **Monday** | 4.6 | 1.4 - 8.7 | 325 - 1434 | 17.7 |
| **Tuesday**   | 4.4 | 1.4 - 8.1 | 880 - 1531 | 18.6 |
| **Wednesday** | 5.7 | 2.4 - 9.2 | 876 - 1155 | 19.3 |

| **Friday** | 5.5 | 3.5 - 9.6 | 815 - 1206 | 19.1 |

The week starts steadily, with **Saturday** and **Sunday** having average prices below four cents. On these days, wind power production is low, which could cause individual price spikes, especially on Saturday evening between 19:00 and 21:00 when the price might exceed seven cents. **Monday** sees a noticeable rise in the average price to 4.6 cents, and the day may include price spikes, particularly in the morning between 8:00 and 10:00, when the price could exceed eight cents.

**Tuesday** and **Wednesday** see a rise in prices, with average prices reaching up to 5.7 cents on Wednesday. This is partly due to weak wind power production, which can increase electricity prices. On Wednesday evening between 18:00 and 20:00, prices may rise above nine cents. **Thursday** and **Friday** maintain similar average prices, but higher prices, close to ten cents, can occur on Friday evening between 20:00 and 22:00.

Throughout the week, temperatures remain relatively high, which is not expected to significantly impact price development. Overall, the week's average prices fluctuate moderately, but individual hourly price spikes are possible, especially when wind power production is lower.
