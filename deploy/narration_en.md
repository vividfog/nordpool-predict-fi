| **Tuesday** | 9,6 | 4,0 - 20,0 | 588 - 2689 | 4,7 |
| **Wednesday** | 10,0 | 2,7 - 20,6 | 802 - 2955 | 5,1 |

The weekly price profile will vary clearly. **Tuesday** and **Wednesday** are projected to see the week’s sharpest peaks: Tuesday’s maximum is estimated at 20,0 ¢ and Wednesday’s at 20,6 ¢. Both days carry a high risk of single-hour spikes. Tuesday’s top is set for the evening at 17–19, while Wednesday’s costliest hours will concentrate in the morning at 07–09.

In **Friday’s** day-level outlook there will also be spike risk. The priciest moment will fall in the late afternoon around 16–18, when the price will reach 10,4 ¢. **On Sunday** the spike risk will stand out in the evening at 18–20, with single hours rising to about 7–8 ¢. **On Monday** the higher levels will appear in the morning at 07–09, with a top hour at 11,6 ¢; the early evening will bring the day’s second-highest range.

Wind output swings will explain part of the dispersion. **On Thursday** the generally strong production (about 4162 MW) will press prices down and bring night-time levels around one cent. **Tuesday’s** and **Wednesday’s** peaks will be supported by exceptionally low minimum wind output, just 588 MW on Tuesday and 802 MW on Wednesday, aligning with the days’ highest maximum prices.

The week’s lowest prices will cluster in the night and late evening hours. **Early Thursday** at 03–05 the price will remain at 0,4–0,6 ¢. **On Saturday** pricing will be subdued throughout, and late evening at 21–23 will see the day’s lows around 1,4–1,6 ¢. During the day from Saturday to Sunday, prices will mostly stay within the 2–7 ¢ range, before the early-week rise accelerates toward Tuesday’s and Wednesday’s highs.
