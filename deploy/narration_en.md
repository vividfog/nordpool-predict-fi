Early in the week the price level will rise. The highest figures will fall on **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**: Tuesday’s average price is expected at 14,5 ¢ and the maximum at 22,4 ¢; Wednesday’s average at 13,1 ¢ and the top at 19,5 ¢. Peak levels are anticipated on Tuesday morning around 7–9, and the risk of price spikes will be elevated. This is explained by a very low minimum wind output, 1109 MW, which is linked to the day’s high maximum; the average wind also remains low (1899 MW). On Wednesday the spike risk will focus on 8–10, and peaks will stay lower than on Tuesday. On both days daytime hours will look clearly more expensive than night and late-evening hours.

The price level will fall clearly from **Thursday** onwards. The average will dip to 8,2 ¢ on Thursday, and between **Friday** and **Sunday** it will stay below four cents (3,2–4,2 ¢). Late-week intra-day variation will remain muted: the lowest hourly prices will occur overnight, typically around 0–3, when the level settles for many hours between 1–3 cents. Next **Monday** the average will tick up slightly to 5,7 ¢ and the day’s high will stay at 9,1 ¢. Strong wind output later in the week will support the low prices.
