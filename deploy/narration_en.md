The week will look split in two. Price levels will rise early in the week, with the highest hours especially on **Tuesday**, when the peak will fall between 17:00–19:00 and reach 23,3 ¢. The day’s very low minimum wind output (804 MW) will explain the spike. **Wednesday** will also feature high hourly prices in the morning between 07:00–09:00, up to 19,6 ¢. Toward the end of the week prices will ease: on **Friday** the average will drop to 3,9 ¢, the lowest level of the week.

Spike risk will also stand out on **Thursday** morning between 08:00–10:00, when the level will reach 17,5 ¢ even though the daily average will stay below 10 ¢. Short-lived spikes may appear on **Monday** and **Sunday** around 08:00–10:00. The cheapest moments of the week will cluster in the small hours of Friday, when the price will dip to 2,5–2,7 ¢ around 02:00–04:00. Wind production will be weak early in the week but strengthen clearly toward the end, pushing prices down especially on Thursday and Friday.
