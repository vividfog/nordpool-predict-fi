The first part of the week is set to be affordable. On **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, average prices settle at 1,6–1,5 cents and variability remains modest. Wind power will be plentiful, which supports the low price level. **Friday’s** average would dip to 1,1 cents, and isolated negative hours would appear in the nights of Thursday and Friday (minima -0,1 ¢ and -0,8 ¢). On **Saturday**, the average would rise to 2,3 cents but stays below four cents.

The standout day is **Sunday**: the average would climb to 4,5 cents and the maximum is forecast at 12,3 ¢. The risk of hourly price spikes would be concentrated around 17:00–19:00, and the high peak is explained by the exceptionally low minimum wind output (about 1 231 MW). Next **Monday** and **Tuesday**, average prices would rise to 5,9 and 6,2 cents, and intraday peaks will be around 10 cents (10,0 ¢ and 9,7 ¢). Overall, the week will progress with the most affordable stretch from Wednesday to Saturday, after which the level rises clearly from Sunday onward.
