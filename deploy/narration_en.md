| **Monday** | 4,3 | 1,5 - 7,1 | 2087 - 3162 | 4,1 |
| **Tuesday** | 0,9 | -0,1 - 2,5 | 3102 - 5898 | 5,0 |
| **Wednesday** | 1,3 | -0,4 - 3,4 | 3674 - 4987 | 6,9 |

Prices will look generally low. On **Tuesday** the average is projected at 0,9 ¢ and on **Wednesday** at 1,3 ¢. Individual negative-price hours are expected from Tuesday to Thursday, mostly overnight and in the early morning. On **Thursday** volatility would be pronounced: daily lows would dip to −0,4 ¢, but the maximum is projected at 12,7 ¢. A low wind-power minimum, 1627 MW, explains Thursday’s higher peak price. On **Monday** the average would be 4,3 ¢ and on **Friday** 3,9 ¢. On **Saturday** the level would stay around 2,0 ¢.

On **Sunday** it will be a public holiday, which may reduce demand and keep the daily average at 3,8 ¢, even though wind power is expected to be low on average. The risk of single-hour price spikes would be focused on Sunday; the highest hour would likely fall in the morning, around 9–11. The week’s cheapest hours will tend to occur especially during Tue–Thu nights, whereas Thursday’s priciest hours would cluster in the afternoon and early evening.
