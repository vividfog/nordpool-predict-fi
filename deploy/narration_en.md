The week’s price trend will be clearly twofold. Early in the week, prices will be elevated, but from Thursday average prices will turn inexpensive. The most expensive day will be **Tuesday**: the average price is 15,9 ¢ and the day’s maximum 27,0 ¢, whereas **Thursday’s** average will stay at 1,3 ¢ and the range will remain 0,0–2,5 ¢.

Price spike risk will stand out on **Tuesday** during individual hours. The peak would most likely occur around 10:00–12:00, with another highlight in the evening at 19:00–21:00. The day’s minimum wind output stays at 480 MW, which explains why the maximum rises to the week’s highest.

On **Wednesday**, spike risk would also affect single hours, especially in the morning at 08:00–10:00, when the forecast shows the day’s peak at 22,5 ¢. The wind trough is still low, 805 MW, consistent with the elevated maximum. Within the day, prices would ease markedly toward the evening.

From Thursday onward, the price level would clearly stabilize. On **Thursday**, strong wind generation (on average over 4000 MW) can explain the exceptionally low level, and the early morning hours 03:00–05:00 will hover around zero. On **Friday** and **Sunday**, average prices will stay below four cents, and on **Monday** the forecast will sit at 4,7 ¢. On **Saturday**, a slightly higher yet still moderate range of 1,8–9,4 ¢ will be seen.

The week’s cheapest periods will cluster around **Thursday** early morning, whereas the most expensive hours will likely fall on **Tuesday** 10:00–12:00. Overall, from Thursday the week will turn clearly more affordable.
