On **Sunday**, the average price rises slightly to 2.4 cents, and the day's maximum price may reach 5.8 cents. Wind power production is lower on Sunday, which could drive prices up. **Monday**, in turn, brings the highest average price of the week at 3.2 cents, with a peak price potentially reaching 5.8 cents.

**Tuesday** and **Wednesday** are expected to remain moderate, with an average price of 1.8 cents. Tuesday is anticipated to be the windiest day of the week, which could support a drop in prices. **Thursday**'s average price rises again to 2.4 cents, and the maximum price could be as high as 6.1 cents, indicating a potential price spike.

The week ends with **Friday**, when the average price rises to 3.5 cents. Wind power production is forecasted to be low, and the day's maximum price could reach 5.9 cents. Throughout the week, the risk of price spikes is present on several days, especially during the afternoon and evening hours.
