|:-------------|:----------------:|:----------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| **Wednesday** | 5.2 | 1.4 - 7.1 | 2514 - 3775 | 0.1 |
| **Thursday** | 3.0 | 1.1 - 7.1 | 1740 - 6555 | 1.1 |
| **Friday** | 1.5 | 0.4 - 3.6 | 3114 - 5769 | 2.1 |
| **Saturday** | 1.0 | -0.5 - 3.1 | 3715 - 5983 | 3.3 |
| **Sunday** | 5.5 | 2.1 - 8.5 | 1812 - 3852 | 2.9 |
| **Monday** | 10.1 | 5.2 - 16.6 | 708 - 1725 | 2.2 |
| **Tuesday** | 11.0 | 4.3 - 17.2 | 1002 - 1505 | 1.6 |

Through midweek the price level will remain low. **On Wednesday** and **Thursday**, average prices will stay below 5 cents, and **Friday** and **Saturday** will likely be the cheapest spell of the week (1.5 and 1.0 ¢). On Saturday there will even be negative hours, down to about -0.5 ¢. Strong wind output from Thursday to Saturday will clearly depress prices. **On Sunday** the average will rise to about 5.5 ¢ and afternoon hours will exceed 8 ¢ as wind weakens compared with previous days.

At the start of next week, the level will shift clearly: **on Monday** and **Tuesday** the week’s highest averages are expected, 10.1 and 11.0 ¢. A risk of price spikes is projected for individual hours on both days. Monday’s peak will most likely fall around 17:00–19:00 (up to about 16.6 ¢), and Tuesday similarly 17:00–19:00 (up to about 17.2 ¢). The high peaks are explained by very low minimum wind output: Monday bottoms at 708 MW and Tuesday at 1002 MW, clearly below 2000 MW.
