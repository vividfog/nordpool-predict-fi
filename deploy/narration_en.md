The price development for electricity in the coming week appears variable but generally reasonable. **Wednesday** stands out with the highest average price of 4.8 cents per kilowatt-hour, with the day's peak reaching up to 9.0 cents. The day's wind power production is comparatively low, which may partly explain the higher prices.

**Sunday** offers the week's most affordable prices, as the average price for the day is only 0.3 cents per kilowatt-hour, and the lowest price even drops negative to -1.1 cents. This day also stands out with high wind power production, which partly lowers electricity prices.

**Thursday** and **Monday** have very similar average prices, around 3.8 cents, but their price fluctuations are more moderate. On both days, wind power is at a reasonable level, allowing for a stable price level.

**Friday** is interesting, as although the average price is 3.1 cents, the day's highest price rises to 7.3 cents. This may indicate occasional price spikes, likely occurring during the morning and evening peak hours.

On **Saturday**, electricity prices remain low, with an average price of 2.0 cents, and most of the day sees prices under three cents. This might offer consumers a good opportunity to use electricity economically.
