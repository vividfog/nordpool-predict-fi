The upcoming week's electricity price forecasts show clear differences between the days. **Saturday** stands out as the most expensive day of the week, with an average price rising to 8.4 cents and maximum prices potentially reaching up to 18.7 cents. This could partly be explained by low wind power production, which averages 1091 megawatts on Saturday. Additionally, there is a high risk of price spikes on Saturday, especially during the morning and afternoon hours.

**Monday** and **Tuesday** are also days with a risk of price spikes, with average prices at 8.7 and 7.0 cents respectively. On Monday, electricity prices could reach up to 18.0 cents, and on Tuesday, they could peak at 15.2 cents. These days might be particularly costly during the morning and evening hours when electricity usage is generally higher.

The most affordable day of the week is **Wednesday**, with an average price of 2.9 cents and a maximum price of only 7.7 cents. Wednesday's low price could partly be explained by the average wind power production of 2016 megawatts. Additionally, no significant price spikes are expected on Wednesday.

**Friday**, **Sunday**, and **Thursday** fall into the mid-range for prices, and these days also have a risk of price spikes during individual hours. This indicates that electricity users should be particularly cautious on these days.
