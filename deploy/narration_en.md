| **Sunday** | 4,9 | 1,8 - 8,9 | 1460 - 3828 | -0,8 |
| **Monday** | 10,6 | 5,5 - 14,4 | 956 - 1569 | -1,2 |

| **Thursday** | 7,8 | 3,8 - 12,8 | 2140 - 4711 | -2,3 |
| **Friday** | 2,9 | 1,4 - 6,0 | 2968 - 5628 | 1,9 |

The start of the week will be clearly more expensive. **Monday’s** average price is expected at 10,6 ¢, **Tuesday’s** at 13,9 ¢ and **Wednesday’s** at 14,9 ¢. The day standing out the most will be **Tuesday**, with a maximum reaching 20,8 ¢. High morning peaks will be explained by very low minimum wind output: on Tuesday only 386 MW and on Wednesday 1 477 MW. The risk of price spikes will be elevated on Monday and Tuesday mornings from 08:00–10:00 and on Wednesday 08:00–10:00; on Monday and Wednesday a second rise will occur in the evening around 18:00–20:00. On **Sunday** the risk for isolated higher hours will be present especially from 18:00–20:00, even though the daily average stays at 4,9 ¢.

In the middle of the week the level will ease. **Thursday’s** daily average will stay at 7,8 ¢, and late-week prices will turn low: **Friday** at 2,9 ¢ and **Saturday** at 1,3 ¢. Behind this will be strong winds that lift average production above 3 000 MW, and even above 5 000 MW on Friday and Saturday. The cheapest hours are anticipated for early Friday morning around 03:00–05:00 and for Saturday 03:00–05:00. From Thursday to Saturday the intraday range will narrow, and the highs will remain under 13 ¢. In the week’s overall picture, the early days will look expensive and the later days inexpensive, with the largest swings occurring in mornings and evenings.
