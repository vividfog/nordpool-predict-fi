At the start of the week, **Tuesday** and **Wednesday** will offer affordable electricity prices, with both days showing average prices falling below one cent. Especially on **Wednesday**, the price expectations are negative, indicating strong wind production. **Thursday** might see a slight increase in prices, although they remain moderate. **Friday** will experience a significant drop in wind power production, pushing the average price closer to one cent.

As the weekend approaches, on **Saturday**, price expectations are rising, with potential price spikes possible during certain hours. A similar situation is anticipated for **Sunday**, where the day's average price already rises to 2.5 cents. The limited wind power supply on Sunday partially explains the higher prices.

Next **Monday**, electricity's average price will remain at the same level as Sunday, although wind power production slightly increases. This suggests that possible price spikes might also occur at the start of the week.
