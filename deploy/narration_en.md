The overall picture for the week will be inexpensive, with prices dropping clearly below four cents from Sunday through Tuesday. Weak wind at the beginning of the week would likely explain Thursday’s and Friday’s higher average prices, while strong wind from Sunday to Tuesday would pull prices down. In addition, Saturday will be a public holiday, which would ease demand and support lower prices.

The risk of price spikes will be concentrated in single hours on Thursday and Friday. Thursday’s peak will likely fall within the morning demand peak at 07:00–09:00, and Friday’s highest level is expected in the evening at 17:00–19:00. On Saturday, an elevated hourly price is most likely in the morning at 07:00–09:00. Negative or near-zero prices are expected from late Saturday evening onwards, and on Sunday even long stretches should stay close to zero.
