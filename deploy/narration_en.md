In the upcoming week's electricity market price forecast, **Friday** is expected to be the most expensive day, with an average price rising to 13.6 cents per kilowatt-hour. This is partly due to the low wind power production, which drops to 193 megawatts. On Friday, there will also be high price spikes, potentially reaching up to 26 cents. Saturday brings a significant price drop, with the average daily price expected to be around 2.4 cents. Abundant wind power production on Saturday partly explains the cheaper prices.

**Sunday** sees prices remain low, with an average price of 2.6 cents. Wind power production remains close to normal, which helps stabilize prices. **Monday** is expected to see a slight increase in prices, with an average of 4.3 cents. **Tuesday** prices decrease slightly again, with an average of 3.5 cents. **Wednesday** is the second more expensive day of the week, with the average price rising to 7.3 cents. This is partly due to the low wind power production, which drops to 1647 megawatts. Later in the week, on **Thursday**, prices settle lower again, with a daily average of 2.9 cents.
