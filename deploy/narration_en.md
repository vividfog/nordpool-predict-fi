Clearly higher average prices are expected at the start of the week. On **Monday**, the average price would be 10,0 ¢, and the day’s peak is timed around 17–19 at 17,1 ¢. **Tuesday’s** average would be 8,9 ¢, and between 7–9 in the morning the week’s highest hourly price, 20,4 ¢, is expected. From Wednesday to Friday, averages will stay between 1–3 cents, and strong wind on these days supports the low price level. **Friday’s** lowest price is projected between 1–3 (about −0,8 ¢). A negative hour would also occur at the start of **Saturday**, around 23–01 (lowest −0,1 ¢). **Sunday’s** average will rise to 6,4 ¢.

The risk of individual price spikes is indicated for two days. On **Tuesday**, the risk is focused on the morning around 7–9, when a maximum of 20,4 ¢ is projected. The day’s minimum wind output stays at 831 MW, and such a low minimum (below 2000 MW) explains the higher maximum price. On **Sunday**, the spike risk is concentrated in the evening at 17–19, when the hourly price may reach 14,9 ¢; at the same time the wind minimum remains near 1000 MW.
