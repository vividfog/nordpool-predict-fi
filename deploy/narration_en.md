Next week's electricity exchange price expectations indicate no major fluctuations. **Sunday** is expected to have the highest maximum price, potentially reaching up to 8.0 cents per kilowatt-hour. This may be due to low minimum wind power production, which will drop to 661 megawatts. The beginning of the week, **Monday** and **Tuesday**, show moderate average prices at 2.3 and 1.3 cents, respectively. On Tuesday, wind power production is expected to be slightly higher, which may keep prices low.

**Wednesday** sees the average price drop to 0.7 cents, marking the lowest expected average price of the week. Wind power production is moderate, and no significant price spikes are anticipated. **Thursday** and **Friday** maintain moderate prices at 1.4 and 1.9 cents. **Saturday** stands out as the cheapest day of the week with an average price of just 0.9 cents. However, both Sunday and Saturday have been flagged for the possibility of price spikes during certain hours, so electricity users should remain alert on those days.

Next week, electricity price expectations remain largely low, offering consumers an opportunity to take advantage of cheaper hours. The decrease in electricity prices over the week may partly be due to consistent wind power production. *Next week's electricity price forecast was composed by gpt-4o.* üå¨Ô∏è
