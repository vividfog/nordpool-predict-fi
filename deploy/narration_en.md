Next week's electricity prices are expected to remain at an affordable level on average. However, price differences between individual days are noteworthy, ranging from Sunday's average price of -0.9 cents to Thursday's and Wednesday's 2.4 cents.

On **Sunday**, electricity prices will remain clearly negative for most of the day, reaching the week's lowest level of -1.9 cents around 1 pm. Even at their highest, prices will barely rise above zero, peaking at 0.5 cents around 8 pm. Sunday's average price will settle at -0.9 cents.

On **Monday**, prices will still be moderate. Early hours of the day will feature negative prices, but the period between 9 and 11 am will push the price up to its highest point of 3.1 cents. Nevertheless, the day's average remains affordable at 0.7 cents.

As the week progresses, electricity prices will gradually rise. On **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, average prices will exceed two cents slightly. The highest hourly price of the week, 5.4 cents, will occur on **Thursday** around 9 am. Thus, Thursday and Wednesday will see the week's highest daily averages, both at 2.4 cents.

Towards the end of the week, prices will slightly decrease again, with **Friday** averaging 1.5 cents. For **Saturday**, the average price is expected to fall further, typical of weekend pricing, settling at one cent. Individual negative price hours will also occur on Friday and Saturday, helping to reduce daily averages.

There will be a risk of occasional price spikes on Sunday and from Tuesday through Saturday. Although forecasted maximum prices are moderate, actual hourly prices during these days could occasionally exceed the estimated peaks.
