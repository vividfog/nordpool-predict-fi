| **Monday**  | 2.7  | 0.3 - 6.0   | 1174 - 3721  | 20.2  |
| **Tuesday**    | 0.9  | -0.4 - 2.3 | 3171 - 4144  | 19.7  |
| **Wednesday**| 0.4  | -1.0 - 1.8 | 1980 - 3955  | 19.4  |
| **Thursday**    | 1.2  | -0.1 - 4.7 | 865 - 2441   | 18.7  |
| **Friday**  | 0.5  | -0.6 - 2.9 | 1383 - 2437  | 18.4  |
| **Saturday**   | 0.8  | -0.5 - 2.9 | 1133 - 2280  | 18.1  |
| **Sunday**  | 0.1  | -1.0 - 1.6 | 1410 - 2618  | 17.9  |

The electricity market price trend for the next week appears variable but generally remains at a low level. **Monday** stands out with a higher average price of 2.7 ¬¢/kWh, and the day's highest price reaches 6.0 cents, which is the highest peak of the week. This is due to low wind power production, especially during morning and evening hours when consumption is typically higher.

The cheapest prices of the week are expected on **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, with average prices below 1.0 ¬¢/kWh. On these days, wind power production exceeds 3000 MW, which partly explains the low prices.

On **Thursday**, there is a possibility of individual price spikes, with the highest prices potentially occurring in the morning and evening, but overall the day remains moderate with an average price of 1.2 cents. The weekend continues on a low-price trend, with **Saturday** and **Sunday** offering the lowest forecasted prices, with the average price on Sunday dropping to even 0.1 ¬¢/kWh.

The week's price trend thus appears predominantly affordable and calm, without significant price fluctuations or unusual weather phenomena that could significantly increase prices.
