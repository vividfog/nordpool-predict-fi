The highest average price is forecast for **Wednesday**, when the day’s average will be 9.6¢ and the maximum will reach 15.9 cents. Wednesday is also expected to carry a high risk of individual price spikes. In the hourly forecast, the day’s most expensive stretch will fall in the evening, roughly from 18:00 to 20:00. **Thursday** is a public holiday, and demand may be lower than usual, which may in turn pull the price down. Toward the end of the week, average prices will mostly settle in the 7–9 cent range, and cold average temperatures will continue from Thursday through Sunday.
