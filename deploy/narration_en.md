The priciest hours of the week are expected early on. On **Wednesday**, the average price would rise to 13,9 cents and the day’s peak to 23,6 ¢. The spike risk would be high, with the most expensive intervals around 08:00–10:00 and 16:00–18:00. A very low minimum in wind output (343 MW) would explain the elevated peak. On **Thursday** and **Friday** the spike risk would also be elevated: Thursday mornings at 08:00–10:00 would approach 16 ¢, and Friday evening at 17:00–19:00 is projected to reach a 16,2 ¢ peak.

Over the weekend the price level would drop clearly. **Saturday** is a public holiday, and the average price is expected to remain at 2,9 cents; brief upticks may occur around midday at 10:00–12:00. On **Sunday**, prices would stay very low: an average of 1,0 ¢ and a low of −0,4 ¢, most likely at 02:00–04:00. Next **Monday** and **Tuesday** the cheap trend would continue, with averages at 2,4 ¢ and 1,3 ¢. Strong wind output late in the week and early next week would push prices broadly below four cents.
