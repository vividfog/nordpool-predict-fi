In the coming week, significant fluctuations are anticipated in electricity prices. **Friday** stands out with the highest average price of 14 cents per kilowatt-hour and the highest maximum price of 27.8 cents. This high price may be due to low wind power production, which averages only 473 MW. There is also a risk of price spikes on **Thursday** and **Tuesday** when wind power production is at a low level. **Saturday** and **Sunday** are expected to be the most affordable days, with electricity costing on average less than 3 cents per kilowatt-hour, and wind power production being more abundant, which helps lower prices.

**Saturday** will see the lowest prices, with an average of only 1.9 cents per kilowatt-hour, and the price range remains below five cents. This is partly due to strong winds. The situation continues similarly on **Sunday**, and wind power production remains high, keeping the price low. **Monday** is slightly more expensive, but still with an average price below four cents. **Tuesday**'s price expectations again show the risk of spikes, particularly in the evening between 18:00 and 20:00 when wind power production is at its minimum. As the week progresses, **Wednesday**'s price is more moderate, but the risk of spikes remains.

According to the forecast, the cheapest electricity moments of the week occur over the weekend, when wind conditions are favorable and the risk of price spikes is low. On the other hand, midweek, especially on **Friday** and **Tuesday**, prices are expected to rise high, which might surprise consumers.
