In the evening, a spike risk will appear at 18:00–20:00, with individual hours reaching up to 17,0 ¢ according to the forecast. The day’s minimum wind output will stay at 1 075 MW, which helps explain the clearly higher peak level on Friday.

Other days will mostly sit between 5–8 cents. **Sunday** stands out as the cheapest: the average will be 3,9 ¢ and the night-time hours will dip to 1,1–2,6 ¢ (around 02:00–04:00). On **Saturday**, the spike risk will fall in the morning at 07:00–09:00. **Monday** and **Wednesday** will remain moderate, while **Tuesday** and **Thursday** will edge closer to the 7–8 ¢ range. On **Thursday**, the spike risk will be concentrated in the evening at 17:00–19:00. Winds will be occasionally weak during the week, and especially Friday’s low minimum output and Thursday’s below-average level may support higher hourly prices.
