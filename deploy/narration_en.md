The upcoming week‚Äôs electricity market seems to remain fairly stable without significant fluctuations between the days. **Wednesday** stands out with its low average price, remaining negative at -0.4 cents. This is partly due to high wind power production, averaging 3920 megawatts on Wednesday. The temperature on the same day is forecasted to be around 19.4 ¬∞C, which does not impact the price.

**Friday**, on the other hand, appears to be the most expensive day of the week, with the average price rising to 1.0 cents per kilowatt-hour. Wind power production is significantly lower on Friday, averaging 2051 megawatts, partly explaining the higher price. A peak hourly price of 5.3 cents is expected on Friday morning.

During the weekend, on Saturday and Sunday, prices remain moderate, ranging from 0.3 cents to 1.2 cents. On Sunday, wind power production is minimal, averaging 1470 megawatts, but this does not significantly increase the average price.

By next Monday, prices are again slightly rising, with an average price of 1.4 cents. On Tuesday, prices drop again, even though wind power production is minimal. In summary, the week‚Äôs price trend is characterized by moderate fluctuations without major spikes or dramatic changes.
