The electricity price forecast for the coming week shows clear variations between days. During the weekend, prices will decrease significantly, even dipping into negative territory during early morning hours on Saturday. **Saturday's** cheapest period will occur between 3 and 5 AM, when the electricity price drops to minus 0.3 cents. On average, electricity on Saturday will cost only about 1.3 cents per kilowatt-hour.

On **Sunday**, electricity prices will remain fairly affordable, with an average price around 2.3 cents. Sunday's cheapest moment will occur overnight between 1 and 3 AM, when prices briefly become negative at minus 0.1 cents. However, Sunday's evening hours between 7 and 9 PM will momentarily increase prices to over six cents.

As the week progresses, prices will rise. Starting from **Monday**, the average electricity price will climb above five cents, moving away from the weekend's lower levels. Monday's peak price, 9.3 cents, will occur between 7 and 9 PM.

The week's most expensive days will fall on **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, when average prices will exceed five cents and intraday maximums will clearly surpass ten cents. Wednesday’s highest forecasted price, 11.5 cents, will occur in the morning between 8 and 10 AM. Thursday's prices will peak even higher, reaching 12.7 cents during the same time period. The week's highest prices are partly linked to temporarily lower wind power production during morning hours.

Overall, next week's electricity price forecast shows a distinct division between an affordable weekend and a somewhat pricier start of the week. Consumers may particularly want to take advantage of the weekend's inexpensive nighttime and early morning hours, when electricity will occasionally be free. Conversely, Wednesday and Thursday morning hours are expected to see the week's highest electricity prices.
