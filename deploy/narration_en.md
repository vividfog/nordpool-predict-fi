The week will start clearly more expensive. **Tuesday** will see the average at 14,1 cents and the day’s high at 21,2 ¢. The risk of spikes in individual hours will be elevated, especially in the morning, 08–10. The minimum wind output will stay below 2000 MW, which explains the unusually high peak. **Wednesday** will ease but remain in double digits: the average is projected at 12,8 ¢ and the peak around 18,5 ¢. Wednesday morning, 08–10, will also carry spike risk.

Later in the week the market will calm down. **Thursday’s** average will drop to 9,0 cents, and from Friday to Sunday prices will be consistently below four cents. Strong winds, on average well above 3000 MW, will support low prices on these days. **Saturday** during the small hours, 02–04, levels will dip below two cents, and also on Sunday they will stay very close to that. Next **Monday** the level will edge up slightly, with the average expected at 6,9 ¢ and the day’s high estimated at 11,7 ¢.
