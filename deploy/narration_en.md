| **Tuesday** | 2,5 | 0,2 - 7,6 | 3093 - 5691 | 3,6 |
| **Wednesday** | 0,7 | -0,2 - 1,8 | 4659 - 5795 | 5,0 |

| **Friday** | 1,7 | 0,4 - 2,9 | 2744 - 3878 | 7,5 |
| **Saturday** | 2,7 | 0,9 - 5,5 | 2080 - 3980 | 6,6 |
| **Sunday** | 3,4 | -0,0 - 8,2 | 1838 - 4325 | 5,0 |
| **Monday** | 6,7 | 2,5 - 12,1 | 1576 - 2979 | 4,1 |

The week will shape up as clearly inexpensive: from Tuesday to Sunday, average prices will mostly stay below four cents. The lowest levels will come midweek, with **Wednesday** averaging 0,7 Â¢ and **Thursday** 1,6 Â¢. Night-time prices will briefly turn negative on Wednesday and Thursday.

The first weekdays of the week would benefit from abundant wind, pushing prices broadly lower. **Tuesdayâ€™s** price range will be 0,2â€“7,6 Â¢, and **Fridayâ€™s** range will narrow to 0,4â€“2,9 Â¢. **Saturdayâ€™s** and **Sundayâ€™s** averages will also stay below four cents, even though Sunday will see a higher intraday maximum of 8,2 Â¢.

The clearest exception will appear next **Monday**, when the average rises to 6,7 Â¢ and the maximum is forecast at 12,1 Â¢. Behind this is weak wind: the dayâ€™s minimum wind output will drop to 1576 MW, and this low minimum also explains the elevated peak price. Monday also carries a noted risk of single-hour surges; the peak would likely fall between 7â€“9.

In summary, the cheapest periods will fall on midweek nights, while the weekâ€™s highest levels will cluster around next Mondayâ€™s morning hours. Price expectations may still shift if the wind forecast changes.
