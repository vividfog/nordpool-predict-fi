During the upcoming week, electricity spot prices will vary considerably depending on the day. Price differences throughout the week will be notable, with the lowest daily average price on **Saturday** at just 0.3 cents, and the highest on **Monday** at 5.8 cents per kilowatt-hour. On average, pricing will remain moderate, though there will be risks of price spikes during certain hours.

The highest individual hourly rate of the week is expected on **Wednesday**, when prices could peak at 14.6 cents during the morning hours between 8:00 and 10:00. Wednesday's high price clearly relates to exceptionally low wind power production during the morning, briefly dipping below 500 megawatts. Price spike risks will also occur on **Thursday**, **Friday**, and **Sunday**, although hourly prices on these days will remain more moderate compared to Wednesday.

The lowest hourly rates will occur during the weekend. On Saturday, electricity will be negatively priced for several hours, reaching as low as about -1.2 cents between 20:00 and 22:00. Early Sunday morning will also feature negative prices, down to -0.7 cents between midnight and 2:00. The weekend's low pricing is partly explained by higher wind power generation, which will intermittently approach about 2800 megawatts on Saturday and Sunday.

Early in the week, on **Monday** and **Tuesday**, prices will fluctuate within a wide range. Mondayâ€™s highest pricing will occur late in the evening from 21:00 to 23:00, with electricity costing over 11 cents. On Tuesday, price fluctuations will be more moderate, with the highest hourly rate at 7.2 cents during the evening between 19:00 and 21:00.

Overall, significant variability between days will characterize electricity pricing for the week. Clear price increases will occur early and mid-week, whereas the weekend will offer electricity at negative prices during several hours.
