The week will look split: the end of the week will be clearly cheaper, while the midweek will be pricier. The lowest average of the week is expected on **Friday** at 3,5 ¢. The highest averages will appear after the start of the week: **on Tuesday** 14,0 ¢ and **on Wednesday** 15,0 ¢. Tuesday’s maximum is estimated at 22,5 ¢, the week’s highest. Wind power’s minimum output will drop to 747 MW on Tuesday, and the day’s maximum price is the week’s highest; the weak wind explains the wide spread. Towards the end of the week, wind output strengthens, putting downward pressure on prices.

The risk of price spikes will stand out on several days. **Sunday evening** will likely see a bump around 18:00–20:00 (forecast 10,0 ¢ at 19:00). **Monday morning** around 08:00–10:00 is projected to rise high (15,8 ¢ at 09:00). **Tuesday evening** will most likely peak at 17:00–19:00 (22,5 ¢ at 18:00), and individual hours could exceed this. **Wednesday** morning will see a spike at 08:00–10:00 (19,2 ¢). **Thursday morning** at 08:00–10:00 is expected to stand out (16,9 ¢).
