In the upcoming week, electricity price trends appear fairly stable without significant fluctuations. Average prices mostly remain below one cent per kWh. **Wednesday** and **Thursday** stand out with their low average prices, partly due to high wind power production exceeding 3000 MW. This strong wind power also explains the low prices on these days.

**Friday's** price expectations rise slightly, with an average price of 0.9 ¢/kWh. This is partly due to reduced wind power production, averaging 1916 MW, which is lower than on other days of the week. **Saturday** and **Sunday** maintain a steady price level, but on Sunday, there could be a price increase in the afternoon and evening hours as wind power production decreases.

**Monday** looks slightly more expensive, with an average price of 1.5 ¢/kWh, partly due to fluctuations in wind power production throughout the day. On Tuesday, the price remains moderate, but forecasts suggest possible price variations as wind power production averages lower.
