Spot electricity prices will vary noticeably throughout this week, with notable differences both between days and within single days. Friday will be the cheapest day of the week, with an average price clearly below two cents and even dipping negative (-0.4 Â¢) in the early morning hours.

The highest average daily price of the week will be on **Wednesday**, estimated at nine cents. On Wednesday, hourly peak prices may rise above 17 cents during the morning, approximately between 7â€“9 am. This is largely due to very low wind power production, dropping to a minimum of just 160 megawatts during those morning hours.

The risk of price spikes will also remain high on **Tuesday**, when individual hourly prices may reach over 12 cents. However, Tuesday's cheapest hours will occur during the early morning, with prices briefly turning negative. On **Thursday**, price fluctuations will remain evident, although the daily average stays moderate at about 5.5 cents.

Heading into the weekend, prices will clearly decrease. On **Saturday**, the daily average will be around 3.3 cents, but some price variation still exists. Electricity will be cheapest in the early morning and most expensive in the evening between approximately 7â€“9 pm. On **Sunday**, the price level will remain quite similar to Saturday, with an average of about 3.4 cents. Sunday's risk for price spikes is concentrated in the evening hours.

Next **Monday**, prices will rise slightly again but will remain reasonable at around four cents. Price variation will especially occur in the evening around 6â€“8 pm, when the hourly rate peaks at just under eight cents.
