In the coming week, the electricity market is expected to show varied developments. **Sunday's** forecast indicates an average price of 1.6 ¢/kWh, which is relatively low. Prices are expected to fluctuate from 0.0 ¢ to 6.6 ¢ in the afternoon. Wind power production is relatively low at that time, partly explaining the higher afternoon prices.

On **Monday**, the average price slightly increases to 2.7 ¢/kWh, but price fluctuations are moderate compared to Sunday. Wind power production increases, which may help keep price spikes at bay.

On **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, prices remain particularly low, with Tuesday's average price at just 1.2 ¢/kWh and Wednesday at 0.4 ¢/kWh. Wednesday's minimum prices are even negative, indicating an abundant supply of wind power and low demand.

On **Thursday** and **Friday**, prices rise slightly from Tuesday and Wednesday's levels. Thursday poses a possibility of individual price spikes in the afternoon, during which prices may increase. Wind power production is lower on these days, which may partly explain the price rise.

On **Saturday**, prices drop again, with an average of just 0.5 ¢/kWh. The forecast mentions a risk of price spikes, but overall, the price level remains low for most of the day.
