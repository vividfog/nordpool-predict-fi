The upcoming week‚Äôs forecast shows clear variability in electricity prices across different days. On **Tuesday**, the week‚Äôs highest peak price will occur, exceeding 17 cents per kilowatt-hour between 19:00 and 21:00. On the other hand, during the night hours, prices will approach zero, with the lowest forecasted price slightly negative. The day's average price, however, will remain below four cents.

On **Wednesday**, the average price will rise significantly, becoming the highest of the week at 8.6 cents. Within Wednesday, price differences will be substantial, with the most expensive hours in the morning between 7:00 and 9:00, potentially rising above 15 cents. These hours carry a special risk of price spikes, meaning actual prices could exceed the forecast. Wednesday‚Äôs high average price is partly explained by the week's lowest wind power, averaging only 560 MW.

On **Thursday**, the price expectation will again drop below four cents on average. Thursday will also have risk for individual hourly price spikes, although the maximum price will clearly remain below Wednesday‚Äôs levels, peaking under eight cents. Wind power production will increase considerably compared to the previous day.

**Friday** will be the cheapest day of the week, with an average price of just 1.8 cents per kilowatt-hour. The day will also feature the week's lowest single-hour price, dipping slightly negative during the night and early morning hours. Wind power will be abundant on Friday, contributing to the low price level.

Weekend prices will be slightly higher than on Friday. On **Saturday** and **Sunday**, average prices will hover slightly above four cents. Both days carry a risk of individual price spikes, with Saturday morning between 8:00 and 10:00 possibly reaching over 10 cents. On Sunday, a similar peak level will occur in the evening between 19:00 and 21:00.

Next **Monday**, the price forecast will remain moderate, with an average price slightly above four cents. The risk of price spikes still exists at the start of the week for individual hours, although the day's maximum price will remain under eight cents.
