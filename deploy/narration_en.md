Electricity prices will vary significantly throughout the upcoming week. However, average daily prices will remain affordable or even very low. Average prices for the entire week will clearly stay under five cents per kilowatt-hour.

The week's lowest average price is expected on **Saturday**, with an average of just 0.1 cents. Negative electricity prices will occur on several occasions Saturday afternoon and late evening, dropping prices around one cent below zero.

The greatest price fluctuations will take place on **Wednesday**, when the forecast maximum price rises as high as 13.7 cents per kilowatt-hour. Wednesday's price peak is expected in the morning hours between 8–10. The risk of price spikes will therefore be high during individual hours.

**Monday** will also experience significant price variations. The day's minimum price will be very low, only 0.2 cents, but in the evening between 19–21, prices will rise to nearly 12 cents. There is also a risk of price spikes during Monday.

On **Thursday**, **Friday**, and **Sunday**, prices will be relatively stable, but the risk of individual price spikes is noted for these days as well. Thursday will briefly experience negative prices early in the morning between 2–3, when electricity consumers are expected to receive up to 0.3 cents per kilowatt-hour. On **Tuesday**, prices will stay moderate throughout the day, with no risk of price spikes anticipated.

The overall price level for the week will remain moderate. However, daily variations will be pronounced, making it advisable for electricity users to closely monitor price developments during individual hours.
