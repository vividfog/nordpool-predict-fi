In the price forecasts, the week will be clearly split in two. On **Tuesday**, the day’s average price will be the highest of the week at 48.5¢, and the price range will stretch from 18.8¢ to 77.0¢. Based on the hourly outlook, the peak will fall in the early-evening window from 16:00 to 18:00. On the same day, minimum wind generation will drop to an exceptionally low 446 MW, and this will explain the higher maximum price.

On **Wednesday**, the average price will fall to 32.5¢, but the data highlights a high risk of price spikes during individual hours. On the hourly level, the day’s highest price will occur in the morning window from 07:00 to 09:00. From **Thursday** onward, daily average prices will settle at roughly 15–22¢. The lowest weekly average will occur on **Sunday**, when prices will also remain the most even and the maximum is forecast at 18.2¢. Freezing conditions will persist throughout the period, as average temperatures will be around -10 to -11°C.
