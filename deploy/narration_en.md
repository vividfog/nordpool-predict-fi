The upcoming days' electricity price forecasts begin on **Saturday**, when prices remain low, even negative, with an average price of -0.1 cents. This is partly due to abundant wind power. On **Sunday**, prices are expected to rise slightly but remain moderate, with an average price of 0.2 cents. This suggests that the weekend will offer relatively cheap electricity.

On **Monday**, prices rise significantly, with an average price of 4.5 cents. This is due to reduced wind power and a slight drop in temperature. **Tuesday** sees the week's highest average price of 10.2 cents and potential price spikes. This is especially due to low wind power production levels and high maximum prices. On **Wednesday**, prices drop back to a reasonable level of 4.9 cents as wind power slightly increases.

Towards the end of the week, on **Thursday** and **Friday**, prices remain relatively stable, with average prices of 3.6 and 3.9 cents. Wind power remains at a moderately good level on these days, helping to keep prices in check. Overall, the upcoming week presents both affordable and more expensive days, with prices expected to move within relatively predictable ranges.
