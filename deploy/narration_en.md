The start of the week will be inexpensive. Especially on **Saturday**, the average price will be 0,2 cents and several negative hours will appear during the night and morning, which is explained by very strong wind. On **Sunday**, the average will stay below two cents, and on **Tuesday** prices will still be clearly below four cents. On **Monday** and **Wednesday**, the level will rise to a more moderate range; Monday’s daily high will reach 8,4 cents.

The clearest exception will be **Friday**, when the average rises to 8,0 cents and the maximum is forecast at 12,8 cents. The peak will most likely fall between 17:00 and 19:00. Weak wind explains the price: wind power’s minimum output drops to 1537 MW and the day’s average remains at 2160 MW, which lifts the level clearly compared with other days.
