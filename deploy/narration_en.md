The coming week will bring variable price trends in the electricity spot market. **Friday** is expected to be the most expensive day of the week, with an average price rising to 14.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. The highest predicted price could reach up to 24.4 ¬¢, possibly occurring in the morning hours from 08:00 to 10:00. Weak wind power, with a minimum of only 131 MW during the day, is partly responsible for the high price level.

**On Saturday**, prices will decrease significantly, with the daily average price settling at 9.6 cents. The highest price could rise to 17.3 ¬¢ in the evening between 19:00 and 21:00. Sunday, on the other hand, will offer the cheapest prices of the week, with an average price of only 3.0 ¬¢. Strong wind power production, exceeding 3000 MW during the day, partly explains the low price.

As the week progresses, the price trend on **Monday** and **Tuesday** remains moderate, with average prices staying below 5.5 cents. **On Wednesday**, the price trend is slightly upward but remains at a reasonable level. **Thursday** forecasts higher prices again, raising the daily average price to 9.9 cents. Weak wind power and high peak prices might occur between 18:00 and 20:00.

The week's price fluctuations bring both affordable and higher-priced moments, making it increasingly important for consumers to consider the timing of their electricity use.
