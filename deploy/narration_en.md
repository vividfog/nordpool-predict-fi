The upcoming week shows clear fluctuations in electricity prices, especially on **Tuesday**, when significant price spikes are expected. Tuesday's average price is forecasted at 13.4 cents per kilowatt-hour, and the day's maximum price may rise to as much as 24 cents. This is particularly due to the low minimum wind power production, which falls below 1000 megawatts. This, combined with the high maximum price, makes Tuesday the most expensive day of the week.

**Thursday** is forecasted to be the cheapest day of the week, with the average price remaining modest at 2.8 cents. Wind power production is strong then, which partly explains the low price. Prices on other days generally remain reasonable, ranging between 3.6 and 6.9 cents.

**Saturday** is expected to see price spikes at specific hours, even though the day's average price is more moderate at 6.7 cents. **Wednesday** is also anticipated to have potential price spikes, which draws attention to that day. Overall, the week is expected to be varied in terms of price sensitivity, but no major deviations are anticipated on other days.
