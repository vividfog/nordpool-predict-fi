Next week's electricity price expectations vary quite a bit from day to day. **Thursday** and **Monday** are expected to be slightly higher in price, with average prices at 3.9 and 4.1 cents per kilowatt-hour. On both days, wind power remains at a moderate level, but **Monday** may see price spikes particularly during the afternoon and evening hours.

**Saturday** sees a significant drop in price expectations, with an average price of just 2.2 cents per kilowatt-hour. During this day, wind power rises significantly, which may partly explain the low price. **Tuesday** is also expected to have a low average price, 1.9 cents, but fluctuations in wind power production could cause individual price spikes in the morning and evening hours.

**Sunday** may have highly variable prices, as the expected maximum price rises above seven cents per kilowatt-hour, although the average price remains moderate at 2.8 cents. Wind power is slightly lower then, which may contribute to higher prices during certain hours.

During the week, particularly on **Wednesday**, a steady price development is expected, although wind power production is slightly higher on average than on other days. This could help keep prices relatively stable without major spikes during the day.
