The spot electricity prices will vary quite notably in the coming days. Prices will be higher at the beginning of the week, gradually decreasing towards the weekend. The most affordable days will be **Saturday** and **Sunday**, when the average price falls below two cents. On Saturday, even negative prices will occur during early morning hours between approximately 2 AM and 4 AM, reaching as low as -0,2 cents per kilowatt-hour.

The highest hourly prices of the week will occur on **Wednesday**, with rates peaking around 10,4 cents per kilowatt-hour between 8 AM and 10 AM. Similarly, on **Tuesday** morning between 8 AM and 10 AM, prices will approach ten cents. Both days include a noted risk for hourly price spikes, potentially pushing peak prices above the predicted levels.

Overall, the week's average price level will remain relatively affordable. Early in the week, average prices will stay slightly below five cents, while towards the end of the week, prices will drop clearly below four cents. **Friday's** average price of 3,4 cents is already significantly lower compared to the beginning of the week.

During the weekend, the spot electricity average prices will be particularly low. On **Saturday**, prices will remain below five cents throughout the day, staying considerably lower for most of the time. Sunday will follow the same trend, with the day's maximum price clearly below five cents.

After this decline in prices, next Monday prices will rise slightly, yet still remain below a four-cent average. The highest price of the day will occur in the morning between 8 AM and 10 AM, reaching 6,9 cents per kilowatt-hour.
