On Wednesday, electricity prices are expected to remain low, averaging 2.1 cents per kilowatt-hour. Wind power supply is normal on Wednesday, and no price spikes are forecasted. On Thursday, however, prices are expected to rise to an average of 6 cents per kilowatt-hour, with a significant risk of price spikes. Low wind power production on Thursday might influence higher prices, especially in the morning from 8 AM to 10 AM.

On Friday, price expectations are slightly lower than on Thursday, but the risk of price spikes remains. Wind power supply is even lower on Friday, which could impact prices. On Saturday and Sunday, electricity prices are expected to be low, with Sunday's average price being just 0.8 cents. Sunday stands out particularly with its low average price and negative minimum prices during the night.

At the start of next week, on Monday and Tuesday, electricity prices are expected to rise again. On Monday, the average price is expected to be 3.9 cents, and on Tuesday, 5.3 cents. Both days carry a risk for price spikes, particularly on Tuesday during morning and evening hours. Wind power production remains low on these days, which may explain the price increase.
