*The electricity price forecast for the week shows significant fluctuations, especially during the weekend when low wind power production raises prices. Saturday is expected to have the highest prices, and price spikes are possible on several days.*

Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is out of production due to maintenance. The maintenance began on 20 September 2025 at 01:00 and is expected to end on 10 October 2025 at 01:00. Loviisa 1 is also under maintenance from 6 September 2025 at 10:00 to 2 October 2025 at 12:00. These maintenance outages may affect the accuracy of the forecast, as there is limited training data available from periods when such maintenance is ongoing.

The forecast was updated on Tuesday at 09:08.

| **Tuesday**   | 5.3 | 0.4 - 15.4  | 1439 - 3046 | 11.2 |

The electricity price forecast for the week shows notable variations. **Saturday** stands out with its clearly highest average price, reaching 16.2 cents. This day is also expected to have the week's highest maximum price, 31.0 Â¢. This is partly due to the very low wind power production, averaging only 627 MW. Such low wind production can drive up electricity prices.

On **Friday**, a high average price of 9.2 Â¢ is predicted, which is also significantly higher than on other days. Price spikes are expected, particularly in the morning and evening, when the maximum price could exceed 20 Â¢. On **Sunday**, price spikes might occur in the afternoon, which is reflected in the predicted high maximum price of 18.2 Â¢.

On other days, such as **Monday** and **Tuesday**, prices are expected to remain more moderate, although minor price spikes might occur. **Wednesday** starts with low prices, and during the night hours, the price could even drop into negative territory, which is an interesting detail at the start of the week. On **Thursday**, price spikes might occur in the morning, but overall, the day's prices are expected to remain reasonable.
