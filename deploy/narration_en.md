A low price level will be expected early in the week. From **Sunday** to **Wednesday**, average prices will settle below five cents. Intra-day variation will remain moderate, and the week’s lowest hourly price will occur during **Sunday** night at 00:00–02:00, when the price touches 0.2 ¢. The lower level will be explained by abundant wind power production, averaging above 3 000 MW on these days.

In the latter half, the price level will climb with weaker winds. On **Thursday**, the average price will rise to 8,6 ¢ and individual upticks will be anticipated around 17:00–19:00, when the maximum is estimated at 12,6 ¢; there will be a risk of spikes. On **Friday**, the difference will be clear: the average will be 10,2 ¢ and the peak at 16:00–18:00 will reach 18,1 ¢; the spike risk will be high, influenced by very low wind output below 1 000 MW. On **Saturday**, it will be a public holiday, which may ease demand, but individual rises will be anticipated at 09:00–11:00, when the maximum is estimated at 11,8 ¢.
