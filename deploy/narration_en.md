Electricity markets this week are expected to show varied prices. **Tuesday** stands out with the highest average price of 8.5 ¢/kWh and potential price spikes that could reach up to 16.6 ¢. Wind power production is lower on Tuesday, contributing to higher prices. **Thursday** also sees high price expectations, with an average price of 9.0 ¢/kWh. Price spikes are anticipated as wind power production is occasionally low.

The lowest prices of the week are expected on **Saturday**, with an average price of just 3.2 ¢/kWh. This is partly due to abundant wind power, which could reach up to 2592 MW. **Sunday** prices remain moderate, with an average price of 4.1 ¢/kWh. Prices remain low also next **Monday**, averaging 4.4 ¢/kWh, due to strong wind power production.

Overall, the week starts with higher prices, but by the weekend, prices significantly decrease. Variations in wind power production affect prices, especially on days with less wind power.
