The upcoming week brings a range of electricity price levels. **Monday** appears particularly affordable, with an average price of just 0.4 cents per kilowatt-hour, and the day's lowest price even being negative at -0.0 cents. This is due to strong wind power production, which remains high throughout the day.

**Wednesday** sees price expectations rise, with an average price of 4.2 cents. Although the day's maximum price rises to 9.9 cents, wind power production remains high and stabilizes the price level. **Thursday** continues along similar lines, with an average price of 3.9 cents.

**Friday‚Äôs** price forecast shows an increase, with an average price of 6.1 cents. There is a risk of price spikes, particularly in the evening, when the forecasted maximum price rises to 11.1 cents. **Saturday**, on the other hand, stands out as the most expensive day of the week, with an average price of 14.2 cents and a maximum price soaring to 27.1 cents. Weak wind power production explains the high prices. **Sunday** continues the relatively high price level, but wind power production improves slightly, which moderates the price increase.
