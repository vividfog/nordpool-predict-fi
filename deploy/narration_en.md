The upcoming week's electricity market shows variability, with different days' average prices indicating fluctuations. **Wednesday** and **Thursday** are expected to have relatively affordable electricity prices, with average prices below five cents. Forecasts for these days do not show significant price spikes, and wind power is at a level that does not significantly impact prices.

On **Friday** and **Saturday**, prices are expected to rise, with significant price spikes possible on Saturday. The maximum price on Saturday may reach up to 17.6 cents, partly due to low wind power production, which can significantly increase electricity prices during certain hours.

**Sunday** returns to more moderate price levels, with an average price around four cents. **Monday** sees prices remain reasonable, but **Tuesday** shows a significant increase, as the maximum price may reach up to 29.7 cents. This is due to very low wind power production, which can raise electricity prices during certain hours.
