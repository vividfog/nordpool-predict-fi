Price expectations for the week will vary clearly by day. **On Wednesday**, the average price would settle around 11,4 ¢ and the day's highest hourly price would rise to 30,4 ¢, most likely during the morning hours 8–10. The day's minimum wind output, just 670 MW, would explain this peak being clearly higher than on other days. Other Wednesday hours would remain largely in single-digit cents, but volatility would be high.

**On Thursday**, prices would sink very low: an average of 1,7 ¢ and a range of -0,3–3,3 ¢. Brief negative prices are forecast for the night around 00–02. Abundant wind (on average over 5000 MW) would support the low price level. **On Sunday**, the price level would remain steady and moderate, with an average of 4,7 ¢ and a range between 3,3 and 6,9 ¢.

The risk of price spikes will be pronounced on several days. **On Friday**, isolated surges would fall in the morning 8–10 window, when the day's 19,7 ¢ peak is forecast; the wind minimum would drop low (688 MW). **On Saturday**, risks would concentrate in the morning 8–10 and evening 18–20 windows, with a 16,5 ¢ peak and wind minima at times below 2000 MW. **On Monday**, the highest values would occur in the evening 18–20, with a 23,2 ¢ peak; the day's wind minimum would be 705 MW. **On Tuesday**, risks would split between the morning 8–10 (peak 21,4 ¢) and the evening 18–20; low wind (min 1039 MW) would support higher hourly peaks.

The week's cheapest hours would concentrate on Thursday night, whereas the week's highest readings would appear on Wednesday morning. On the other days, variations would follow the daily rhythm: mornings and evenings would be the typically pricier times, especially on Friday, Monday and Tuesday, when wind output would stay low on average and lift the price peaks.
