The upcoming week in the electricity market will see significant fluctuations, with Friday's high average price of 13.7 ¢/kWh standing out. This day is also forecasted to have high maximum prices, up to 28.1 ¢/kWh, possibly due to low wind power minimum production of only 193 MW. **Wednesday** offers a wide price range, with the day's maximum price potentially reaching 19.2 ¢/kWh, even though the average price remains more moderate at 5.7 ¢/kWh.

**Saturday** and **Tuesday** offer cheaper electricity, with average prices staying below three cents. On Saturday, wind power production is notably strong, which explains the low price. **Sunday** and **Thursday** hover at reasonable prices, but price spikes may occur during individual hours on Sunday and Thursday. **Monday** sees a slight increase in the average price, but it remains below five cents, which is affordable.

The weekend's price variations are significant, but the beginning of the week offers more stable prices. High electricity prices typically occur during morning and evening hours, especially on Friday evening, when the maximum price could be substantial.
