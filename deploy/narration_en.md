The start of the week looks inexpensive. **Thursday**’s and **Friday**’s public holidays will reduce demand, which will show especially in Thursday’s average price of 1,8 ¢. Thursday’s abundant wind output (5130–7480 MW) will support the low level, and at night 00–02 the price will dip below 0,5 ¢. **Friday**’s average will rise to 4,2 ¢, and toward evening clearly higher hours will appear, around 18–20 about 8–8,4 ¢, as wind is weaker (min 2236 MW). **Saturday**’s average will return to 1,8 ¢ and intraday variation will be small.

Midweek the price level strengthens. **Sunday** is expected to settle at 2,7 ¢. **Monday**’s average will be 3,4 ¢. **Tuesday**’s average will rise to 5,1 ¢, and in the evening 18–20 the price will reach 7–7,7 ¢. The highest day of the week will be **Wednesday**, with an average of 5,6 ¢ and a daily high of 10,2 ¢. The highest hours will fall on Wednesday evening, about 22–24. Overall, the early week will mostly cluster below four cents, and a clear rise will appear only from Tuesday onward.
