The upcoming week offers varying price trends, with Friday and Saturday being the most affordable days as the average price remains below one cent. Wind power will be strong on these days, supporting the low price levels. On Sunday, prices rise slightly, with a notable price peak expected during the evening hours, potentially exceeding 11 Â¢. On Monday and Tuesday, prices remain moderate, but individual price spikes may occur, especially during the morning and evening. On Wednesday, the average price rises to 4 Â¢, highlighting the higher price level of the day.

Thursday stands out as the most expensive day of the week, with both average and maximum prices reaching high levels. Wind power production is expected to be low, partly explaining the high price level. The associated high risk of price spikes makes Thursday particularly interesting to watch.
