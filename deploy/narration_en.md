The upcoming week in the electricity market is expected to feature significant price fluctuations. **Tuesday** and **Wednesday** stand out with particularly high average and maximum prices. **Tuesday's** average price rises to 9.0 cents per kilowatt-hour, and the maximum price may reach up to 17.7 cents. This is partly due to weak wind power production, which remains below 1000 megawatts, especially in the morning hours. **Wednesday** may see electricity prices rise even higher, averaging 10.3 cents, with a peak price of 22.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. On these days, price spikes are possible during individual hours.

On **Thursday** and **Friday**, price expectations are more moderate, and wind power production remains at a higher average level. The average prices for these days range between 7.6 and 6.9 cents, which is significantly lower than the high prices earlier in the week. The weekend also looks more affordable, with **Saturday** and **Sunday** offering average prices below four cents, although price spikes may still occur during individual hours.

Based on these forecasts, electricity prices will vary significantly throughout the week, with price sensitivity particularly evident during the high prices at the beginning of the week. The weekend, however, offers more affordable prices, which may encourage consumers to shift their electricity usage to the weekend.
