The upcoming period will mostly remain inexpensive. Average prices will stay clearly below four cents from **Wednesday** through **Monday**. Midweek holidays — **Wednesday**, **Thursday** and **Friday** — will dampen demand and support a low price level. Especially on **Thursday** wind power production will be very strong, which will show up as an exceptionally low range of 0.2–3.4 ¢. On **Saturday** the lowest average price, 1.7 ¢, will be reached. In addition, from Wednesday afternoon to late evening prices will sink close to fractions of a cent for several hours.

Most clearly standing out is **Tuesday**: the average price will rise to 7.8 ¢ and the day’s peak to 10.8 ¢, which, according to the forecast, will fall in the evening, around 18:00–20:00. The other days will remain moderate, although on **Monday** the level will edge up close to four cents. Overall, the period will be inexpensive, with prices skewing low toward the weekend before Tuesday’s clearly higher day.
