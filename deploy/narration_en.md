Weekly price expectations are projected to split in two: at the start and end of the week, average prices will mostly stay below four cents, while midweek will be pricier. On **Monday**, the average price is expected to reach 3,6 ¢. On **Tuesday**, it is projected to rise to 7,8 ¢ and on **Wednesday** to 7,2 ¢. On **Thursday**, it will return to around 5,9 ¢. On **Friday** and **Saturday**, averages will remain at 3,4–3,2 ¢, and on **Sunday** around 4,8 ¢. The lower averages on several days will be explained by abundant wind power, whereas on **Tuesday** wind will on average be weak.

The risk of price spikes will stand out only on **Tuesday** and **Thursday**. Tuesday’s highest hourly price, 13,4 ¢, would occur at 07:00–09:00. This is supported by an exceptionally low minimum wind output (1058 MW), which explains the week’s highest peak. On **Thursday**, a potential spike would fall at 17:00–19:00, with a top price around 7,9 ¢. The cheapest hours of the week are projected for the small hours of Saturday morning, when the price would drop to about 0,5 ¢.
