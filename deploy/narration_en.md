The week will start off inexpensive. **Sunday** will average 0,8 ¢ and the range will stay between 0,1–3,0 ¢. **Monday** will average 4,1 ¢, clearly under five cents. **Saturday** is expected to be the lowest of the week: an average of 0,4 ¢ and even negative prices in some hours. The holiday will lower demand and push prices down.

Costs will concentrate midweek. **Tuesday** will average 11,3 ¢ with a forecast maximum of 24,6 ¢. Wind will be weak (average 1418 MW), which supports the higher price level; the risk of single-hour spikes will be around 18:00–20:00. **Wednesday** will see wind average fall to 930 MW (calm), an average price of 13,5 ¢ and a peak of 23,8 ¢; spike risk around 16:00–18:00. **Thursday** will see the week’s highest peak, 28,0 ¢, with an average of 13,4 ¢. A very low minimum output (345 MW) will explain this high peak; spike risk around 17:00–19:00.

**Friday** will ease to a 5,7 ¢ average, but single-hour spike risk is still forecast, most likely around 08:00–10:00. The cheapest periods will fall on the weekend: **Saturday** morning around 05:00–07:00 prices are expected to dip below zero, and **Sunday** night and morning hours will mostly stay below one cent. The priciest periods will cluster from Tuesday to Thursday, especially in the afternoon and early evening.
