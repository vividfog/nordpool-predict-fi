The weekâ€™s outlook will split clearly into two parts. **Sunday** will be very inexpensive, with the average at 0,8 Â¢, and **Monday** will stay under five cents (4,7 Â¢). Around midweek the level will rise: **Tuesday** is forecast to average 10,8 Â¢, **Wednesday** 13,0 Â¢, and **Thursday** 12,2 Â¢. **Friday** will ease back to 6,2 Â¢, and **Saturday** is a public holiday with the average expected at 0,5 Â¢; in the early hours the price would dip below zero. The most distinctive day will be **Thursday**: average 12,2 Â¢ and a daily peak at 26,8 Â¢.

Spike risk will be highlighted from Tuesday through Saturday. **Tuesday**â€™s peak would fall around 17:00â€“19:00 (about 19,6 Â¢), linked to a very low wind minimum (766 MW). **Wednesday**â€™s top hour will appear around 07:00â€“09:00 (24,4 Â¢), and **Thursday** around 17:00â€“19:00 could see the weekâ€™s sharpest spike, up to 26,8 Â¢; on both days the wind minimum stays clearly under 2 000 MW (587 MW and 343 MW), which explains the outlying peaks. **Friday**â€™s spike risk will concentrate in the morning at 06:00â€“08:00, but the level will remain around 13,4 Â¢. **Saturday** may see spikes in the afternoon at 16:00â€“18:00, even though the day is overall very cheap; the lowest hours will land in the early morning at 05:00â€“07:00, when the price touches -1,8 Â¢.

Overall the week will be variable: Satâ€“Sun and Monday will be cheap, **Friday** moderate, and **Tuesday**â€“**Thursday** will be expensive. The most affordable moments will fall on Saturdayâ€™s early morning, while the costliest hours will land on Wednesday morning and Thursday early evening. As this is a forecast, the timing and level of individual peak hours may still shift, especially if the wind forecast changes.
