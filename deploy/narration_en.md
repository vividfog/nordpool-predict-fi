The week will be uneven. Prices will stay very low already on **Saturday**, when wind power will be abundant and the average price will settle at 0,8 cents. After that, prices will rise during the workweek: daily averages will sit between 6,5–13,1 cents, and the week’s highest daily level will be seen on **Friday** at 13,1 cents. The sharpest hourly peak of the week will appear on **Wednesday** at 19,4 cents, and minimum wind output (1026 MW) will be unusually low, which explains the high peak.

Spike risks will be elevated at the indicated times. On **Sunday**, the evening peak will concentrate at 17:00–19:00. On **Monday**, the morning will tighten at 8:00–10:00. On **Tuesday**, a rise toward evening will be seen at 18:00–20:00. On **Wednesday**, the morning will be tight at 8:00–10:00. On **Thursday**, the peak will occur at 16:00–18:00, and on **Friday**, the evening peak will concentrate at 18:00–20:00. Weak average wind on most weekdays (about 1 300–1 900 MW) will support higher price expectations, whereas Saturday’s strong output will keep the level clearly lower.
