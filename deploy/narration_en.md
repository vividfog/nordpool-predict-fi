The week will start clearly pricier than it ends. **On Monday** the daily high is projected at 12.1 ¢, with the most expensive hours expected in the afternoon at 16:00–18:00. The pronounced peak is partly explained by a very low wind power minimum (917 MW). **On Tuesday** the average price will remain the week’s highest, at 7.6 ¢. A few notably dearer hours are anticipated in the morning at 07:00–09:00.

**From Wednesday** to **Friday** public holidays may lower demand, supporting a more moderate price level. Thursday’s average is projected at 4.4 ¢ and Friday’s at 3.4 ¢. From Thursday onward, wind power would be abundant, which pushes prices clearly lower. The tail end of the week will look inexpensive: **on Saturday** the average is estimated at 2.5 ¢ and **on Sunday** at 2.8 ¢, with the lowest prices concentrated overnight and in the late morning. The week’s most distinct peak will likely occur on Monday, while the weekend stays consistently below four cents.
