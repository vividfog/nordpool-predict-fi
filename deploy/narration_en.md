Electricity price trends for the coming days appear variable. According to forecasts, the most affordable day of the week will be **Tuesday**, when the average electricity price is expected to fall to just 2.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. Even Tuesday's peak hourly prices will remain modest, staying below four cents throughout the day.

In contrast, prices on **Thursday** will rise noticeably. Thursday's average price will be the week's highest, at 8.2 cents per kilowatt-hour. Additionally, the highest individual hourly price of the week, 14.1 cents, falls on Thursday evening between 19:00–21:00. The risk of price spikes on Thursday is high, partly due to low wind power generation. The day's lowest wind production will drop well below 1,000 megawatts, contributing to rising prices.

Significant hourly price differences will also occur during the weekend. On **Saturday**, prices vary between 1.3 cents and 11.6 cents. Highest prices are expected in the evening between 19:00–21:00. Sunday's scenario is similar, with peak prices again occurring in the evening hours from 19:00–21:00. On both days, the risk of hourly price spikes is high.

At the beginning of the week, particularly on **Monday**, price differences will still be notable. Within the day, electricity prices fluctuate between 1.9 and 12.4 cents, with the highest prices falling in the evening around 19:00–21:00. The possibility of price spikes on Monday exists, although slightly lower than during the weekend.

Towards the end of the week, price levels rise again. On **Friday**, the average electricity price is 7.8 cents, but hourly differences will be more moderate; the lowest price is 4.2 cents, and the highest is 13 cents. Friday's peak prices occur in the evening between 19:00–21:00, though no risk of price spikes is expected for Friday.

Thus, price fluctuations will be significant in the coming week, and electricity users may benefit from monitoring prices closely, especially during evening hours. Future price developments will continue to depend significantly on variations in wind power generation and other market-influencing factors.
