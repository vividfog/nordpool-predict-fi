A high risk of spikes in individual hours is also flagged for the day, and the highest hours in the forecast fall roughly between 18:00 and 20:00.

**Thursday** is a public holiday, and demand is expected to be lower than normal, which may push the price down. A high risk of hourly spikes is also flagged for Thursday, even though the day’s top forecast remains at 11.9¢. For the weekend, average prices will settle in the 7.6–9.0¢ range. Next **Monday**, the week will become clearly more expensive, as the average price rises to 14.1¢ and the highest hourly price reaches 20.5¢, and spike risk stands out around 15:00–17:00.
