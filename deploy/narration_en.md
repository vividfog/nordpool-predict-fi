The upcoming week brings fluctuating electricity prices, although average prices remain reasonable below four cents. **Sunday** is expected to be the cheapest day of the week with an average price of 2.2 ¢/kWh, but prices may rise to 8.6 ¢/kWh in the evening. **Monday** also maintains a moderate price with an average of 3.0 ¢/kWh, and no price spikes are anticipated.

**Tuesday** and **Wednesday** may see individual price spikes. The highest price on Tuesday, 10.0 ¢/kWh, could occur in the early evening around 18:00-20:00 due to fluctuations in wind power production. On Wednesday, the risk of price spikes is in the afternoon between 17:00-19:00, with a maximum price potentially reaching 8.0 ¢/kWh.

**Thursday** and **Friday** keep average prices moderate, though higher prices may appear on Friday afternoon. Saturday concludes the week with a slightly lower average price, but evening price spikes remain a risk.

Average wind power production remains at a low level throughout the week, which may contribute to price fluctuations. This is particularly evident when wind power production is at a minimum below 1000 MW.
