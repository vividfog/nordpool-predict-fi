The upcoming week's price forecasts show clear differences between days. **Saturday** and **Sunday** are expected to be affordable days, with average prices staying below one cent. Especially on Saturday, electricity prices might even turn negative, which is exceptional. During these days, wind power is abundantly available, partly explaining the low prices.

**Monday**, on the other hand, stands out with a higher average price of 5.6 cents. The day's maximum could rise above 14 cents, and wind power production is forecast to fluctuate significantly. This makes Monday the most expensive day of the week, with the risk of price spikes particularly during the morning and evening hours.

**Tuesday** is forecasted to have moderate price levels, averaging 1.9 cents, with plenty of wind power available. Wednesday sees a slight increase in price, but remains reasonable with an average of 3.3 cents. Thursday and Friday again bring rising prices, with averages at 5.0 and 6.2 cents. On these days, wind power production is lower, which partly explains the higher prices.

In summary, the expected prices for the coming week vary significantly, particularly on Monday and Friday, when higher individual prices should be anticipated. The weekend days are characterized by affordable electricity prices, thanks to strong wind power.
