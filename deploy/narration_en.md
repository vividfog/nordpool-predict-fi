Prices are forecast to rise early in the week. **Monday** will average 10,7 ¢ with a peak at 15,7 ¢, **Tuesday** averages 14,0 ¢ with the week’s highest maximum at 21,2 ¢, and **Wednesday** averages 14,6 ¢ with a 19,2 ¢ top. On these days, minimum wind output drops below 2,000 MW (Mon 783 MW, Tue 438 MW, Wed 1,406 MW), which explains the higher peak hours. Price spikes are anticipated on these days, with peaks expected around Mon 18:00–20:00, Tue 07:00–09:00 and Wed 08:00–10:00.

The latter part of the week turns clearly cheaper. **Thursday** drops to a 7,4 ¢ average, **Friday** averages 3,0 ¢ and **Saturday** 1,1 ¢, with the minimum touching 0,0 ¢. **Sunday** stays around 4,4 ¢. Strong wind from Thursday onward explains the low late‑week prices: average wind exceeds 3,000 MW and reaches about 5 GW on Friday–Saturday, which pushes price expectations lower.
