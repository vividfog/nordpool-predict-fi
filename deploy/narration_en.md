The weekend will start with moderate prices. **Friday** will average 5,3 ¢, and the night hours (00:00–05:00) will be clearly below one cent. **Saturday** is projected to average 3,5 ¢, with a stable profile. **Sunday** will rise to a 6,6 ¢ average, and the spike risk on individual hours will focus on the evening around 18:00–20:00; the daily high then is 11,3 ¢. The cheapest day of the week will be Saturday.

**Monday** will pick up to 7,5 ¢. Higher levels will appear midweek: **Tuesday** will average 12,5 ¢, with the evening peak expected around 16:00–18:00 (20,6 ¢); **Wednesday** 14,4 ¢ on average, with a morning peak around 08:00–10:00 (22,9 ¢); **Thursday** will average 11,9 ¢, with an evening peak around 16:00–18:00 (17,5 ¢). These peaks will be explained by very low minimum wind production, which will stay below 1,000 MW from Tuesday to Thursday, increasing spike risk and explaining the large intra-day price spreads. The week’s highest hourly price is projected for Wednesday.
