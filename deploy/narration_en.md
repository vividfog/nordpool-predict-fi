Clear differences will be seen during the week. The highest price expectations will focus on **Tuesday**: the average is expected at 12,1 ¢ and the maximum at 20,9 ¢. A spike in individual hours will be anticipated in the morning at 08–10 and in the evening at 18–20. With minimum wind generation clearly below 2000 MW (1193 MW), the high peak is explained. On **Monday** the average is expected at 9,6 ¢ and the peak at 18,4 ¢; a spike will be anticipated at 17–19 as the wind minimum is 1034 MW. On **Saturday** the average will be projected to settle at 8,4 ¢. Wind will be exceptionally weak (avg 761 MW), so pricier hours may occur around 16–18. On **Wednesday** a spike risk will exist, and the intraday high will likely focus on the morning around 08–10, even though the level stays below 7 ¢.

The most affordable development will be expected on **Thursday** (avg 2,8 ¢) and during **Friday** (avg 3,2 ¢), when wind power will be abundant and prices will remain broadly low. Friday night is projected to dip briefly below zero, down to -0,1 ¢ around 02–04. **Sunday** will also be a public holiday, which typically lightens demand; the average price is expected at 3,0 ¢.
