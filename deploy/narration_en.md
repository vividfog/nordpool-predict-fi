No major fluctuations are expected in the electricity market for the coming week. **Monday** starts the week with an average price of 3.4 ¬¢/kWh, which is slightly elevated, but wind power remains moderate at 648-1756 MW. Electricity prices might briefly rise in the morning, potentially leading to price spikes, particularly during morning and evening hours.

The most economical day appears to be **Tuesday**, when the average price drops to 0.8 ¬¢/kWh. Wind power production increases significantly, likely helping to keep prices low. On **Wednesday**, price expectations rise slightly to 1.6 ¬¢/kWh, but there is considerable variation in wind power production, which could cause price spikes during the day.

**Thursday** and **Friday** are relatively stable in terms of prices, but on Friday, the average price rises slightly to 2.9 ¬¢/kWh. This is partly due to weak wind power production, which averages below 1000 MW. Electricity prices remain reasonable over the weekend on **Saturday** and **Sunday**, but Sunday might experience price spikes, especially in the evening.

Overall, the electricity market does not appear to have major surprises in store, but price spikes could still occasionally catch one off guard. The forecast suggests that the week will offer several economical opportunities for electricity usage.
