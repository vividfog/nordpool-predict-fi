At the start of the week, prices are expected to be very low. **Tuesday** and **Wednesday** averages are expected around 0.8–0.9 cents, with negative prices during some night hours (lowest about −0.3 ¢). **Thursday**’s average is projected to rise to 5.5 ¢, and price spikes are anticipated around 16:00–18:00, with hourly levels up to 15.4 ¢. The spikes are partly explained by very low minimum wind output (below 2,000 MW).

**Friday** and **Saturday** averages are expected to stay under four cents with moderate variation. **Sunday** is a public holiday, so demand is expected to ease at times, but weak wind keeps levels partly elevated; the morning stands out around 09:00–11:00, when the top price is seen at about 12.5 ¢. **Monday**’s average is estimated at 6.0 ¢, with the clearest rise in the morning around 07:00–09:00 (max 10.3 ¢). The cheapest moments of the week are expected in the early-week nights.
