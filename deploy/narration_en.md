Electricity price forecasts for the coming days show varying prices. Early in the week, on **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, price fluctuations will be significant, and especially on **Thursday**, individual hours carry a high risk of price spikes. On Thursday morning between 7 and 9, prices will rise above 15 cents. Similarly, Wednesday will see its highest prices in the evening between 20 and 22, when the price level exceeds 15 cents.

**Saturday** stands out as the cheapest day of the week, with an exceptionally low average price (0.8 ¢/kWh). On Saturday afternoon between 16 and 17, prices are expected to dip into negative territory at -0.1 cents. Also, early on **Sunday**, the electricity price will briefly become negative between 2 and 3 in the morning. Sunday's average price will rise slightly but remain clearly affordable at around two cents.

On **Friday**, average prices will be below five cents, making the day overall affordable. However, approaching the weekend, prices will rise above 11 cents during Friday morning between 8 and 9. There is a large difference between the end of the workweek and the very low weekend prices.

At the start of the new week, on **Monday** and **Tuesday**, electricity prices will again be slightly higher than during the weekend, yet remain moderate with an average of around 4.5 cents. Prices will stay stable without significant peaks, reaching at most just below ten cents.

Overall, the week's price variation will be substantial. The cheapest hours will mainly occur during the weekend and nighttime, while the most expensive hours will usually coincide with weekday morning and evening consumption peaks.
