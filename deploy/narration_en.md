*The forecast points to moderate prices early in the week, a cheap weekend, and clear spike risks Tue–Wed as weak wind depresses output, especially during evening and morning peaks.*

Olkiluoto 1 has a production shortfall. Available output is 470 MW (nameplate 890.0 MW), availability 52.8%. The disturbance began on 22.10.2025 at 02:00 and is expected to end on 23.10.2025 at 15:00.

The forecast was updated on Wednesday at 14:18.

| **Thursday** | 5,1 | 0,4 - 8,6 | 2573 - 5693 | 6,3 |
| **Friday** | 6,3 | 2,7 - 10,9 | 1109 - 2384 | 7,5 |
| **Saturday** | 2,3 | 1,2 - 4,5 | 1828 - 4494 | 6,6 |
| **Sunday** | 3,9 | 1,5 - 6,3 | 1932 - 4482 | 5,0 |
| **Monday** | 6,8 | 2,7 - 11,8 | 1877 - 2466 | 4,7 |
| **Tuesday** | 10,1 | 3,6 - 21,7 | 603 - 2504 | 4,7 |
| **Wednesday** | 10,6 | 3,0 - 21,3 | 817 - 2693 | 5,1 |

Price expectations would stay moderate in the first part of the week. **Thursday** would average 5.1 cents. Night-time hours would be priced very low, down to 0.4 ¢ in the early morning, and daytime would rise at most to around 8.6 cents. Abundant wind power would explain Thursday’s low price level.

**Friday** would average 6.3 cents. Spike risk is anticipated for individual hours, and the day’s peak would be near 16:00–18:00, around 10.9 ¢. Heading into the weekend, prices would calm: **Saturday** would drop to a 2.3-cent average with a narrow range. **Sunday** would also stay moderate, averaging 3.9 cents.

At the start of the new week the level would rise. **Monday** is estimated at a 6.8-cent average, and there would be spike risk for individual hours; the peak would likely fall around 17:00–19:00 (up to 11.8 ¢). On Tuesday and Wednesday the market would stand out clearly from other days. **Tuesday** would average 10.1 cents with a projected maximum of 21.7 ¢. Wind power’s minimum output would drop very low, to 603 MW, which would explain the high peak; the peak would be timed to the evening, around 17:00–19:00.

**Wednesday** would record the week’s highest average, 10.6 cents, with a maximum of 21.3 ¢. Again the wind minimum would remain clearly below 1,000 MW (817 MW), creating a high spike risk. The day’s sharpest peak would fall in the busy morning hours, around 07:00–09:00.

The week’s cheapest hours would land in Thursday’s early morning, while the most expensive segments would concentrate on next Tuesday’s and Wednesday’s peaks. Volatility would be large especially in early-week evening and morning peaks, as wind generation runs at very low levels.
