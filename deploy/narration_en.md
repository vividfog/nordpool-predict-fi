Overall, the week’s price outlook will remain at a high level. From **Tuesday** onward, daily average prices will fall in the range of 11.8–23.2 ¢/kWh, and the most expensive day will be next **Monday**, when the average will rise to 23.2 cents and the day’s highest hourly price will reach 39.6 cents. The cheapest hours will occur at the start of **Tuesday**, when the price will drop to 3.1 cents.

The highest peaks will occur on several days during daytime hours. On **Thursday**, the highest hourly price will climb to 28.7 cents around 09:00–11:00, and on **Monday** the peak will rise around 07:00–09:00. The forecast notes a high risk of individual hourly price spikes for every day, and therefore intraday variation will be especially pronounced when the peak hour falls in the morning or early afternoon.
