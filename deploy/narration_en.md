A clear day-to-day variation will be seen during the week. The price level will stay low at the beginning of the week and again toward the end, but the middle will be distinctly more expensive. **Tuesday** is expected to bring the week’s highest average price, 17,1 ¢, and the sharpest peaks. Wind output will dip to a minimum of 487 MW, and this low level will explain the unusually high daily maximum, projected at 29,3 ¢.

Spike risk will focus on Tuesday morning and evening. The morning peak will most likely fall between 9–11, with another high window in the evening around 19–21. On **Wednesday**, the risk of isolated peaks will persist, especially in the morning from 8–10, when the day’s top hour, 23,7 ¢, is expected. Prices will ease toward the evening within the day.

Later in the week the level will drop clearly. On **Thursday** the average price is projected at 2,4 ¢, with a narrow range of 1,3–3,5 ¢. There will be ample wind in the generation mix, which will support low prices. **Friday’s** average will rise to 5,6 ¢, but extremes will stay moderate. On **Saturday** isolated peaks will reappear: the morning 8–10 and evening 19–21 will stand out, approaching the day’s ceiling of 10,6 ¢. On **Sunday**, prices will return to a very low level, averaging 2,2 ¢.

The week’s cheapest hours will fall in the first night and early morning on Monday, when prices will stay well below one cent for an extended stretch. A broad low-price window will repeat on Thursday and Sunday, when hourly prices will remain in the 1–4 ¢ band throughout the day. The highest single-hour price is anticipated on Tuesday, while the tightest range across the week will occur on Thursday.
