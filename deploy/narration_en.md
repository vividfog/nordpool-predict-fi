|:-------------|:----------------:|:----------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| **Monday** | 11,4 | 6,8 - 15,9 | 988 - 2501 | -1,2 |
| **Tuesday** | 13,5 | 7,6 - 21,4 | 703 - 3552 | -1,2 |
| **Wednesday** | 14,7 | 8,1 - 20,4 | 1812 - 3666 | -2,6 |
| **Thursday** | 8,9 | 5,8 - 13,6 | 1760 - 5490 | -2,3 |
| **Friday** | 4,2 | 2,4 - 6,1 | 3137 - 5572 | 1,9 |
| **Saturday** | 3,0 | 1,8 - 4,0 | 4859 - 5658 | 3,1 |
| **Sunday** | 4,0 | 2,2 - 5,6 | 3536 - 5220 | 2,3 |

The start of the week will be more expensive. On **Monday** an average price of 11,4 ¢ is expected, on **Tuesday** 13,5 ¢ and on **Wednesday** 14,7 ¢. Weak wind early in the week will lift the price level, and Tuesday’s exceptionally high peak is explained by a very low wind-power minimum (703 MW). The risk of price spikes is indicated for Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. Peaks are expected roughly Monday 18:00–20:00 (max 15,9 ¢), Tuesday 8:00–10:00 (max 21,4 ¢) and Wednesday 17:00–19:00 (max 20,4 ¢).

Later in the week the price level will clearly ease as wind power is plentiful. On **Thursday** an average of 8,9 ¢ is projected. The rest of the week will be inexpensive: on **Friday** 4,2 ¢, on **Saturday** 3,0 ¢ and on **Sunday** 4,0 ¢. The lowest hours will occur early Saturday night around 00:00–02:00, when prices dip to 1,8–2,4 ¢; Friday late evening and early Sunday night will also stay near four cents.
