Prices over the week will settle at a low level: the average price for every day will stay below five cents. The clearest outlier will be **Monday**, with an average of 4,3 ¢ and a daily high of 8,8 ¢; the highest hour will fall between 17:00–19:00. **Friday**–**Sunday** are expected to be the cheapest stretch of the week with averages of 2,1 ¢, 1,5 ¢ and 1,9 ¢. Wednesday and Thursday will land around 3,2 ¢, Tuesday at 3,9 ¢. Strong wind generation, broadly above 3 000 MW, will help explain the low prices; on Thursday and Friday output will be especially abundant.

Intraday patterns will stand out at a few times. **Wednesday’s** peak will fall between 06:00–08:00 and **Tuesday’s** between 08:00–10:00. The week’s lowest hours will be seen on **Saturday** around 05:00–07:00 and next **Monday** at 02:00–04:00, when the price will dip to 0,2 ¢. At other times, variation will remain moderate, especially over the weekend, when hourly prices will mostly stay clearly below three cents. Windy conditions will support this overall picture throughout the week.
