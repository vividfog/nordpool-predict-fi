There will be plenty of variation in price expectations for the week. **On Thursday**, the average price would be 4.3 ¢ and the maximum 9.7 ¢, and ample wind generation would weigh on prices. **On Saturday**, the average price would settle at 5.4 ¢. **Sunday** is a public holiday, which may lower demand; the average would be 4.6 ¢ and the maximum 10.2 ¢. **On Monday** and **Tuesday**, the week’s highest averages would be seen, 11.0 ¢ and 12.4 ¢, and Tuesday’s maximum is forecast at 22.0 ¢. **On Wednesday**, the average would be 4.8 ¢ and the maximum 6.7 ¢, with plentiful wind power.

Price spikes are assessed as possible on **Friday** in the early evening around 17–19 (up to 14.5 ¢), as well as on **Saturday** in the morning 8–10 (14.4 ¢) and on **Sunday** in the morning 9–11 (10.2 ¢). Early in the week the risk would stand out: **on Monday** around 17–19 (18.0 ¢) and **on Tuesday** in the morning 8–10 (22.0 ¢); on Tuesday in the early evening 16–18 prices would also be elevated. The higher peaks would be linked to low minimum wind output clearly below 2000 MW: 862 MW on Monday and 1070 MW on Tuesday.
