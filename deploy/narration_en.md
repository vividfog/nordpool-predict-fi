The upcoming week in the electricity markets is expected to show fluctuating price trends. **Friday's** average price rises to 3.1 cents per kilowatt-hour, and intra-day price spikes may occur particularly during morning and evening hours, with prices potentially rising up to 7.5 cents. On Saturday and Sunday, prices decrease, with Saturday's average price at 2.0 cents and Sunday's at 1.7 cents. Increased wind power production on Saturday may partly explain the lower price level.

Next **Monday**, price expectations rise again, with the average price settling at 4.1 cents. Monday's maximum price rises to 7.3 cents, which may be due to low wind power production during morning and evening hours. **Tuesday** and **Wednesday** see slightly more stable prices, with average prices at 2.6 and 2.9 cents. Tuesday's price expectations are more moderate, but Wednesday could see price spikes in the afternoon.

Next **Thursday**, the average price rises to 3.3 cents, and fluctuations in wind power production may impact price variations throughout the day. Overall, price expectations are moderate, but individual price spikes may occur during the week.
