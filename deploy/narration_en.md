Price levels will vary clearly over the week. **On Saturday** and **on Monday** the week’s highest averages are anticipated, 12,4 ¢ and 11,5 ¢. **On Sunday** and midweek prices will turn low, and the bottom of the week is expected **on Friday**, with a 1,6 ¢ average. Strong winds from Sunday to Friday will largely explain the low levels.

**On Saturday** a clear spike risk is projected for individual hours. The day’s minimum wind output will drop to 850 megawatts, which explains the higher peak level. The peak would fall between 8–10, with up to 21,4 ¢ in the forecast. Individual peak hours could materialize higher than forecast.

**On Monday** the risks of individual spikes will continue. Minimum output will remain at 1062 megawatts, which is linked to the day’s peak. The priciest window would be 17–19, with a forecast high of 20,7 ¢. Intraday variation could be large.

**On Tuesday** the average will land at 7,7 ¢, but the spike risk will still be elevated. The minimum for wind power is estimated at 1496 megawatts, and the daily high would occur around 8–10 (18,0 ¢). **On Wednesday** and **on Thursday** prices will broadly stay under five cents, reflecting wind above 3000 megawatts. **On Friday** prices will run between 0,7–3,1 ¢, with the cheapest hours in the late night and around midday.
