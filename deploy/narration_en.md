Price developments over the week will be variable. **Friday’s** average price will clearly be the week’s highest, at 15,6 ¢, and the day’s peak will reach 33,4 ¢. Wind power’s minimum output will drop very low that day (674 MW), which explains the expensive morning peak around 07–09. **Sunday** and **Wednesday** will form the week’s cheapest core: their averages will be 5,7 ¢ and 3,9 ¢, classifying them as cheap.

On **Saturday**, a high risk of spike prices is expected. According to the forecast, the morning peak will fall between 08–10, with the top at 21,9 ¢. Intraday variation will be large, and an especially low wind minimum (855 MW) helps explain the higher peak.

On **Monday**, isolated spikes will be possible, especially in the evening around 18–20, when the day’s top will rise to 19,7 ¢. The wind minimum (1209 MW) will stay below 2000 MW, which contributes to the peak. On **Tuesday**, spike risk will also appear in the morning hours 08–10, reaching 17,1 ¢. Even if the day’s average wind is high, the minimum output (1496 MW) will stay below 2000 MW, which can explain short-lived price bumps.

On **Wednesday**, prices will stay even between 1,9–5,8 ¢, and strong wind output will push the average down. On **Thursday**, spike risk will pick up; the day’s high will land between 09–11 (15,2 ¢). The week’s cheapest individual hours will occur in Friday’s night window 01–03, when prices dip to 1,8–1,9 ¢. Sunday evening will also offer broadly sub–five-cent levels.
