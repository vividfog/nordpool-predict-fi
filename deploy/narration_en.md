*Next week’s power prices will stay elevated, but Sunday will be clearly cheaper. Morning and evening spikes are a risk on several days.*

The forecast will be updated on Saturday at 14:20.

| ""  | avg<br>price<br>¢/kWh | min - max<br>¢/kWh | wind power<br>min - max<br>MW | avg<br>temperature<br>°C |
|:-------------|:----------------:|:----------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| **Monday** | 10,8 | 4,3 - 17,6 | 511 - 1040 | -0,5 |
| **Tuesday** | 13,5 | 6,2 - 21,3 | 249 - 1448 | -1,1 |
| **Wednesday** | 12,9 | 8,1 - 19,3 | 769 - 1389 | -1,7 |
| **Thursday** | 10,4 | 7,3 - 15,7 | 1069 - 2373 | -3,2 |
| **Friday** | 12,6 | 3,5 - 19,9 | 1031 - 1888 | -3,2 |
| **Saturday** | 8,7 | 5,6 - 12,9 | 1013 - 1720 | -1,7 |
| **Sunday** | 4,5 | 0,5 - 9,5 | 527 - 5891 | 0,3 |

The week would look on the expensive side, with most days averaging between 10 and 14 cents. A clear exception would be **Sunday**, with an average at 4,5 ¢ and the cheapest hours at night 0:00–2:00 around 0,5 ¢. The most pronounced day would be **Tuesday**: average 13,5 ¢ and a maximum of 21,3 ¢. Persistently low wind power would support this: Tuesday’s minimum output would drop to 249 MW, clearly below 2000 MW, which explains the higher maximum price.

The risk of price spikes would stand out early- and midweek: on Monday in the morning around 8–10, on Tuesday in the morning 8–10 and in the evening 17–19, and on Wednesday in the morning 8–10. On Thursday the peak would fall in the evening 17–19, and on Friday in the same evening window 17–19, when individual hours would typically rise above 15 ¢. **Saturday** would most likely see a spike around 16–18. Intraday variation would thus be largest from Tuesday to Friday, whereas Sunday would bring the softest levels of the week.
