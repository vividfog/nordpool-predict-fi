In the week's price development, there are notable fluctuations, especially on **Wednesday** and **Tuesday**, when price expectations are significantly higher. **Wednesday's** maximum price rises to 22.2 Â¢, standing out clearly from the rest of the week's price development. At this time, the risk of price spikes is high, especially during morning and evening hours. Low minimum levels of wind power production may partly explain these price spikes.

On **Thursday**, the price level drops significantly, with an average price of 5.3 Â¢. Although the price is more moderate than on **Wednesday**, individual price spikes may occur. During **Friday** and the weekend, prices are expected to be exceptionally low due to strong wind power. The average price for Friday is forecasted at only 2.1 Â¢ and on Saturday at 0.5 Â¢.

Next **Tuesday**, price expectations rise again, with a maximum price predicted at 14.8 Â¢. This increases the risk of price spikes, particularly during morning and evening hours. Wind power production is expected to be at a low level at this time, which may partly influence the rise in prices.
