Prices will vary significantly. **On Wednesday**, the average price is forecast at 15,2 ¢ and the day’s high at 22,1 ¢. This is explained by very weak wind, as the minimum output drops to 323 MW. The cheapest day of the week will be **Sunday**: an average of 5,2 ¢ and a low of 2,6 ¢, driven by exceptionally strong wind. High-priced hours are also expected on **Friday** (20,7 ¢) and next **Tuesday** (21,4 ¢) in the evenings, supported by a low wind minimum, 890 MW on Friday and 972 MW on Tuesday.

Spike risk will be noted as follows: **Thursday** 08:00–10:00, **Friday** 17:00–19:00, **Saturday** 08:00–10:00, **Monday** 08:00–10:00 and next **Tuesday** 17:00–19:00. Otherwise, prices will settle at moderate levels on Thursday (avg 11,0 ¢) and Saturday (avg 8,1 ¢), while Monday is at 9,9 ¢ and next Tuesday at 13,5 ¢. The week’s lowest hours will cluster on Sunday and the highest in the evenings of Wednesday and Tuesday.
