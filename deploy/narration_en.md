The week’s most expensive hours will concentrate in the evening. On **Friday**, the average price is expected at 8,8 ¢ and the maximum at 15,0 ¢. A high-spike risk will fall between 18:00–20:00, and the very low minimum wind output (1108 MW) explains the expected peak. On **Thursday**, a similar evening spike risk will stand out between 18:00–20:00, with the day’s high projected at 13,8 ¢ and wind bottoming at 997 MW. On **Wednesday**, a potential peak would occur around 17:00–19:00 (max 13,0 ¢). On **Saturday**, the spike risk will lean to the morning hours 07:00–09:00, with a daily high of 11,4 ¢.

Otherwise, the price level will remain moderate. On **Sunday**, the week’s lowest average, 2,9 ¢, will be seen, and the cheapest moments are estimated around 05:00–07:00, when prices dip to roughly 1–1,5 ¢. **Monday’s** average is 4,0 ¢. On **Tuesday** (6,3 ¢) and **Wednesday** (7,5 ¢), prices will move closer to the weekly mean. **Thursday’s** 7,8 ¢ and **Friday’s** 8,8 ¢ will make the end of the week clearly pricier than the beginning, with evening peaks standing out especially during hours with the weakest projected wind output.
