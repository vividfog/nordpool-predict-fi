Electricity price expectations vary moderately in the coming week, but notably, Monday's predicted average price is slightly higher, around 4.2 cents. This is partly due to wind power production remaining at a relatively lower level. On Monday, prices are expected to peak above 7 cents, potentially leading to price spikes, especially in the morning and evening.

The cheapest electricity prices are expected on Sunday, with an average price forecasted at only 1.8 ¬¢. Saturday also offers low prices, averaging 2.1 cents, with prices during the day nearing zero, at a minimum of 0.5 cents.

The greatest price fluctuation of the week is expected on Friday, with prices ranging from 1.2 cents to nearly 8 cents. This suggests potential price spikes throughout the day. The largest fluctuation in wind power production is seen on Wednesday, which may explain the price variations on that day.

Overall, electricity prices remain quite moderate, with no significant deviations expected. Wind power production is mostly at a conventional level, supporting price stability.
