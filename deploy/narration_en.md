The week’s price level will be mostly low. On **Tuesday**, the average price will settle at 4,2 cents, and winds will be on the weak side, keeping early-week levels slightly higher than later in the week. The clearest exception will be **Wednesday**, when the average climbs to 6,2 cents and the day’s high reaches 12,2 cents. It will be a public holiday, which usually softens demand, but wind power’s minimum output will drop to 1441 MW; this unusually low level explains the higher peak. A risk of hourly spikes will be concentrated in the morning, roughly 8–10 a.m.

**Thursday** and **Friday** will also be public holidays, and prices will stay low with averages of 3,1–3,3 cents. **Saturday** will be the cheapest day of the week, with a 2,5-cent average and prices remaining throughout below four cents. On **Sunday**, levels will remain moderate. Next **Monday**, prices will edge up a bit, with a 4,5-cent average and a top at 6,6 cents. Strong winds late in the week will push prices clearly down, especially from Thursday to Saturday.
