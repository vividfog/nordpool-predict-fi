Next week, significant fluctuations in electricity prices are expected. **Friday** and **Saturday** offer affordable price expectations, with the average electricity price staying below one cent. **Sunday** stands out with its higher prices, as the average price rises to 4.8 cents and the maximum price surges to over 21 cents. This is due to low wind power production, which drops to a minimum of only 808 megawatts on Sunday. This low wind power production combined with a high maximum price indicates a risk of price spikes on Sunday, especially in the evening hours.

The following **Monday**, the price level stabilizes somewhat, although the risk of spikes remains possible. The average price is expected to be around 3 cents, but the day's maximum price could surprise. **Tuesday** and **Wednesday** are expected to have quite similar developments, but on Thursday, prices may rise again, with the average price climbing to 3.4 cents and the maximum price exceeding 11 cents.

Overall, next week is expected to include both affordable and more expensive days, so electricity consumers should monitor daily changes. *Forecast interpreted by gpt-4o.* üîç
