The upcoming week's electricity price forecasts show clear variations between days. **Tuesday** is expected to be the cheapest day of the week, with an average price of 1.6 cents. On Wednesday and Thursday, the price level rises significantly, with the forecasted average price on these days being 4.2 and 4.9 cents, respectively. Notably, **Thursday** is marked by a high maximum price that could reach 12 cents. This might be due to low wind power production, which drops below 1000 megawatts early in the day.

On **Friday** and **Saturday**, prices settle at more moderate levels, with average prices at 2.3 and 2.9 cents. **Sunday** continues to maintain a reasonable price level, with a forecasted average of 2.6 cents. The week concludes with **Monday**, when the predicted average price is 4.1 cents. On this day, there is also a risk of price spikes, particularly in the morning and evening hours.

Wind power production varies significantly throughout the week, impacting price fluctuations. On **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, low production levels may increase prices, while stronger wind power on **Tuesday** and **Friday** helps keep prices lower.
