The upcoming week offers moderate electricity market prices, with average prices staying below three cents per day. **Monday** stands out with the highest average price of 2.8 cents, but towards the end of the week, the prices are noticeably lower. **Wednesday** has the lowest average price of just 0.4 cents, which might be explained by strong wind power production, averaging 2932 MW.

On **Thursday**, however, there is a risk of price spikes, as the maximum price could rise to 4.5 cents, even though the average price remains moderate. Thursday's wind power production varies significantly, which may affect price fluctuations. Over the weekend, wind power production remains reasonable, and prices stay low.

As the week concludes on **Sunday**, price expectations remain subdued, although the maximum price may temporarily rise to 3.6 cents. Wind power production stays conventional, and the temperature is not expected to significantly impact prices.
