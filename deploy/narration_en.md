The first half of the week will be inexpensive. Expected prices will stay around 0.8–1.9 ¢ from Wednesday through Saturday, and negative night hours are likely on Thursday, Friday and Saturday. Wind output will be abundant then, which should keep prices low. Day-to-day swings will remain moderate, with peak hourly prices mostly around 3–4 ¢.

Over the weekend and at the start of next week the price level will rise. On **Sunday** the average will be 4.5 ¢ and a clear evening peak is forecast at 17:00–19:00 (up to 11.8 ¢). On **Monday** the average will climb to 7.5 ¢, and a morning peak at 08:00–10:00 may reach 14.5 ¢. **Tuesday** stands out: its average (10.2 ¢) will be high and the evening peak at 18:00–20:00 is forecast to reach 19.4 ¢. Tuesday’s minimum wind output will drop to 980 MW, which explains the unusually high evening peak; individual peak hours could materialize higher than forecast.
