Saturday stands out during the week with high exchange electricity prices, as the day's average price rises to 10.6 cents per kilowatt-hour. The maximum price of the day, 20.6 ¬¢, is also noteworthy. The high price is partly due to the low minimum wind power production, which is only 118 MW. On Sunday, prices drop significantly, with the average price settling at 3.7 cents. There is also a risk of price spikes on Sunday, particularly in the afternoon.

On Monday, forecasts promise cheap electricity, with an average price of only 2.0 ¬¢. This is partly due to strong wind power, which raises production to an average of 3127 MW. On Tuesday, prices rise again, with the day's average price at 5.9 cents. There is also a risk of price spikes on Tuesday, especially in the evening.

On Wednesday, prices are expected to rise further, with an average price of 7.9 ¬¢. The highest price of the day, 17.2 ¬¢, may be seen especially during the morning and evening hours. On Thursday, prices drop again, with an average price of 2.0 cents. Friday, meanwhile, offers the cheapest prices of the week, with the average price falling below one cent per kilowatt-hour.
