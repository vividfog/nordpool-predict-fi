The start of the week will stand out as more expensive. Weak wind output will be seen especially on **Monday** and **Tuesday**, with average prices of 8,3–8,9 ¢. The highest daily maximum is forecast for Monday, 14,7 ¢; this is explained by the very low minimum wind output (1104 MW). Single-hour spikes are expected on Monday around 17:00–19:00. Tuesday’s morning highs will fall around 8:00–10:00 (up to 14,1 ¢). **Wednesday** is a public holiday, which may lighten demand, but an evening spike risk will still be anticipated around 17:00–19:00 (max 14,2 ¢).

After Thursday, the picture will turn clearly cheaper. Strong wind and holidays will push levels down: on **Thursday** the average price will be 3,9 ¢, on **Friday** 2,0 ¢. On **Saturday** prices will remain moderate (avg 3,1 ¢), and on **Sunday** the week’s lowest average of 0,9 ¢ will be reached. The cheapest hours of the week will fall in Sunday’s night and morning, when the price will stay around 0,3–0,7 ¢. The rest of the week will mostly remain below four cents.
