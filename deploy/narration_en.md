The week’s price level is expected to diverge. On **Wednesday**, the average price is projected to be the highest, 14,2 ¢, with a daily peak of 22,6 ¢. This is explained by an exceptionally low minimum wind output, only 329 MW. On **Friday** and **Tuesday**, averages are expected around 11–12 cents, whereas on **Sunday** the lowest average of the week, 5,5 ¢, is anticipated and peaks will stay below 9 ¢. Strong winds on Sunday (maximum 4508 MW) explain the low prices.

Price spike risk will typically fall in the morning and evening. On Wednesday, spikes are expected at 07–09 and 16–18. On Friday, the risks focus on 08–10 and 18–20. On Tuesday, the evening 18–20 is expected to be the clearest peak, with elevated prices also possible at 09–11; this coincides with low wind output. On **Thursday**, **Saturday** and **Monday**, any spikes will mainly cluster in the morning, around 08–10.
