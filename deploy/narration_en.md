The week’s price profile will dip over the weekend and rise markedly in the middle of the week. The lowest levels will be seen on the two weekend days, while the highest average prices will be concentrated from Tuesday to Thursday. The highest individual prices will fall in the evening and morning hours midweek.

**Friday’s** average price will settle at 6,2 ¢ and the range will be 2,6–9,4 ¢. Wind output will be modest on average, which will keep the day only moderate overall. On **Saturday** the price level will drop to 2,8 ¢ and remain even. On **Sunday** the price is expected to be lower still, at 1,9 ¢, and abundant wind (avg 4333 MW) will explain the low level.

On **Monday** the average will rise to 6,3 ¢. A risk of isolated price spikes has been flagged for the day, with a likely emphasis in the evening around 18–20.

Volatility will be highest midweek. On **Tuesday** the average will be 9,7 ¢ and the maximum is projected at 22,5 ¢, with the peak around 17–19. On **Wednesday** the average will climb to 12,3 ¢, and a morning peak will align with 07–09 (max 21,2 ¢), with another emphasis in the 16–18 afternoon window. On **Thursday** the week’s highest average, 13,5 ¢, will pair with a 22,3 ¢ maximum, most likely in the 08–10 morning slot or the 16–18 afternoon. The exceptionally low minimum wind outputs on these three days (Tue 749 MW, Wed 589 MW, Thu 494 MW) will clearly explain the higher peak hours.

In the overall picture, weekend prices will be low, whereas from Tuesday to Thursday the level will be high. The standout day will be Thursday, combining the week’s highest average (13,5 ¢) with pronounced morning and evening peaks.
