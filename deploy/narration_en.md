In the coming week, the electricity market price development will vary across different days. **Monday** is set to start the week with the highest average price, approximately 3.9 Â¢/kWh, partly due to low wind power production. The highest predicted price is 7.9 Â¢/kWh, which may present challenges for consumers.

**Tuesday** appears to be the most affordable day with an average price of only 0.7 Â¢/kWh. Strong wind power production helps to keep prices low. On Wednesday, price spikes are expected, especially in the afternoon, while the average price remains moderate at 2.3 Â¢/kWh.

**Thursday** sees a slight increase in price expectations, with an average price of 4.0 Â¢/kWh. With wind power production at a low level, the risk of price spikes increases. **Friday's** prices are moderate, and price spikes may occur, particularly during morning and evening hours.

The weekend begins on **Saturday** with a more stable price development. The average price remains at 2.5 Â¢/kWh, but the risk of price spikes persists. **Sunday** returns to an average price level of 2.3 Â¢/kWh, and although there is a risk of price spikes, wind power production may help to smooth out price fluctuations.
