The upcoming week's electricity price development on the exchange appears volatile. **Monday** and **Tuesday** will offer the most affordable prices, with average prices at 0.7¢ and 2.1¢ respectively. On these days, prices might drop to negative at times, which results from strong wind power production, especially on Monday. On Wednesday, the price forecast rises significantly, with an average price already at 5.1¢. This is due to both low minimum wind power production and a higher maximum price, rising to 12.1¢.

**Thursday** sees a calming in price development as the average price drops to 3.4¢, with wind power production close to the usual level. **Friday** and **Saturday** once again have the same average prices at 5.1¢ and 5.4¢, but Saturday holds a risk for price spikes.

**Sunday** stands out as the most expensive day of the week, with an average price rising to 11.1¢ and the maximum price reaching as high as 24.3¢. This results from particularly low wind power production, dropping below 1000 MW. There is also a high risk of price spikes on Sunday, which may occur especially during morning and evening hours.
