| **Monday** | 3,9 | 1,4 - 6,5 | 2576 - 4602 | 1,5 |

| **Thursday** | 7,4 | 2,1 - 11,4 | 1664 - 4331 | 3,0 |
| **Friday** | 9,6 | 3,3 - 17,5 | 888 - 1999 | 2,9 |
| **Saturday** | 8,4 | 4,6 - 13,9 | 618 - 1623 | 1,9 |

The start of the week, from **Sunday** to **Wednesday**, will be inexpensive: average prices will stay between 2,1–3,9 cents and intraday variation will be small (minima 0,2–1,2 ¢, maxima 3,6–6,5 ¢). Strong wind generation will explain the moderate level. The cheapest hours will be concentrated from night into morning.

On **Thursday** the price level will rise, and spike risk is anticipated for individual hours. The highest readings will fall around 08–10 and 16–18, as the minimum wind output drops low (1664 MW), pushing the maximum to 11,4 ¢. On **Friday** the spike risk will be high: a very low wind minimum (888 MW) and a forecast peak at 17,5 ¢ around 15–17. Under these conditions, individual peak hours may exceed the forecast. On **Saturday** it will be a public holiday, which may reduce demand, but weak winds (min 618 MW) will keep the risk in place; the top level would fall around 17–19 and reach 13,9 ¢. The end of the week will thus be clearly more expensive than the beginning, with volatility accentuated by weaker wind output.
