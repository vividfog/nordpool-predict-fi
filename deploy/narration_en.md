The early-week price level will remain low. On **Wednesday** the average price is projected at 0,5 ¢, and sub-zero hours will land in the late night and early morning, roughly 03:00–05:00. On **Thursday** the average is 1,6 ¢, with negative hours expected in the pre-dawn period around 02:00–04:00. On **Saturday** the average will be 0,9 ¢, and prices will dip below zero around midday, 11:00–13:00. Strong wind power on these days will push prices down.

Later in the week the price level will rise. **Friday’s** average is 3,6 ¢, and a spike risk is indicated for single hours; the highest hour is set for the evening, 18:00–20:00, around 7,5 ¢. **Sunday’s** average is 3,9 ¢, with an evening peak focused at 17:00–19:00, about 10,4 ¢. The intraday variation is also explained by the wind minimum dropping below 2000 MW.

The new week will turn clearly more expensive. **Monday’s** average will be 7,9 ¢ and the day’s top hour about 14,2 ¢ in the evening, 18:00–20:00. Weak wind and a low minimum, around 1750 MW, will support the evening peak. Spike risk will apply to individual hours.

The clear outlier is **Tuesday**. The average will rise to 12,2 ¢ and the top hours are forecast around 26,3 ¢ in the evening, 17:00–19:00. The spike risk is described as high, backed by a very low wind minimum around 1000 MW. The price outlook may still be refined if the wind forecast changes.
