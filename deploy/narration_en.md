The week will start clearly more expensive. **On Monday**, the average price is expected to be 8,6 ¢ (daily range 1,5–15,8 ¢). The evening peak is projected for 17:00–19:00, when the forecast reaches 15,8 ¢. The high maximum price is linked to a very low wind power minimum (953 MW), which drops well below 2000 MW. **On Tuesday**, the level eases to 7,4 ¢, though isolated bumps may still occur in the morning around 08:00–10:00, with an hourly high of 10,4 ¢.

**From Wednesday** onward, three consecutive public holidays may reduce demand, and prices will settle at moderate levels. **On Thursday**, the average is 4,3 ¢; **Friday's** is 3,2 ¢; and the weekend will be inexpensive: **Saturday** 2,0 ¢ and **Sunday** 2,2 ¢, mostly between 1–3 cents. The week's cheapest moments will fall on Saturday morning around 07:00–09:00 (minimum 0,9 ¢) and Sunday afternoon 13:00–15:00 (minimum 1,1 ¢). Later in the week, wind output will be abundant, supporting the low price level.
