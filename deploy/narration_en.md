This week's electricity price forecast will show clear daily variations. Prices will remain higher at the beginning of the week, but by the weekend, electricity rates will decrease significantly.

The highest prices of the week will occur on **Tuesday**, with an average price expected at 5.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. At certain hours, prices could rise close to ten cents. The risk of price spikes is particularly high in the morning between 9‚Äì11, when wind power production will reach its weekly minimum at only about 210 MW.

Prices will also stay relatively high on **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, although slightly lower than on Tuesday. Wednesday's highest price peak, around 11 cents, will occur in the morning hours between 8‚Äì10. On Thursday, the highest peak price will be around eight cents, occurring approximately between 7‚Äì9 in the morning.

As the weekend approaches, electricity rates will clearly decline. On **Friday**, the average price will fall below four cents. The cheapest prices of the week will occur on **Sunday**, when the average price will drop below one cent. On Sunday night, electricity prices will even become negative briefly, reaching as low as -0.2 cents per kilowatt-hour around 2‚Äì3 a.m.

Next **Monday**, prices will rise again slightly but remain moderate. The average price for Monday is expected to be 3.2 cents per kilowatt-hour, with hourly rates staying below six cents.

Price fluctuations this week will be significant, largely due to variations in wind power production. At times, wind power production will be very low, explaining the high peak prices during morning hours early in the week. Sunday's very low prices, on the other hand, will result from abundant wind power availability throughout the day.
