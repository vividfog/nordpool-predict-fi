*Next week's electricity price expectations remain mostly affordable, but individual price spikes could temporarily increase costs. Tuesday stands out with its low average price, offering consumers an opportunity to save on electricity expenses.*

The electricity price expectations for the coming week range from moderate to affordable levels. **Tuesday** is particularly notable for its exceptionally low average price, which is predicted to be only 0.9 cents per kilowatt-hour. This is due to strong winds significantly increasing wind power production. The day's minimum price is even negative, which is rare but possible when there is an abundance of wind power available.

On **Monday** and **Thursday**, the average prices are slightly higher, around 3.5 ¬¢/kWh, but still remain affordable. On both days, individual price spikes are expected, so consumers should pay attention to morning and evening hours when prices might rise. On **Monday**, a price spike may occur between 7-9 am, while on **Thursday**, the evening spike could happen between 6-8 pm.

**Saturday**, on the other hand, offers more stable price development, and the weekend as a whole appears affordable in terms of prices. The average price remains at a reasonable level, and wind power production is typical. Temperature forecasts do not indicate significant changes in electricity demand either.

Compared to the beginning of the week, **Wednesday** and **Friday** are predicted to have slightly higher average prices, around 3.0‚Äì3.4 ¬¢/kWh. Although these prices are also favorable for consumers, individual price spikes are possible, so electricity users could benefit from price awareness, especially on these days.
