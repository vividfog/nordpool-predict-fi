| **Sunday** | 3,5 | 1,9 - 5,8 | 1346 - 2864 | 5,4 |
| **Monday** | 11,1 | 2,3 - 19,6 | 765 - 2409 | 3,1 |
| **Tuesday** | 9,4 | 5,3 - 19,2 | 804 - 4360 | 1,2 |
| **Wednesday** | 3,0 | 1,6 - 4,6 | 1308 - 4538 | 1,4 |
| **Thursday** | 2,5 | 0,2 - 5,2 | 3487 - 4363 | 1,4 |
| **Friday** | 2,4 | -0,6 - 7,2 | 2487 - 5118 | 2,2 |
| **Saturday** | 1,9 | 0,6 - 3,3 | 3859 - 4572 | 1,1 |

The week’s start will stand out. On **Monday** the average price is expected to rise to 11,1 ¢ and the maximum to 19,6 ¢. The risk of price spikes will be high, with the peak occurring roughly at 17:00–19:00. The high maximum is linked to an exceptionally low minimum wind output (765 MW). On **Tuesday** the price is expected to remain elevated, with an average of 9,4 ¢ and a peak of 19,2 ¢. The spike risk will concentrate in the morning around 08:00–10:00, again associated with a very low wind minimum (804 MW).

From midweek onward the price level will calm down. From **Wednesday** to **Saturday** averages will mostly stay in the 1,9–3,0 ¢ range, and strong winds will push prices lower. On **Friday**, in the early night around 01:00–03:00, a negative hourly price is expected, the low at -0,6 ¢. **Sunday** is a public holiday, and prices are forecast to remain within 1,9–5,8 ¢; the daily average is projected at 3,5 ¢. Overall, the week’s start appears expensive, while the end of the week will be clearly cheaper.
