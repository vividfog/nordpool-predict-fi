In the coming week, the electricity market is expected to have variable price trends. On **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, slightly higher average prices of 3.9–4.6 ¢/kWh are anticipated due to low wind power production, which remains below 1000 MW. Particularly on **Tuesday**, evening hours could see prices rise to as much as 7.7 ¢/kWh, potentially increasing the day's average price.

**Thursday** and **Friday** will see slightly more moderate prices, although **Friday's** maximum price may rise to 8.5 ¢/kWh during the evening hours. This may be due to fluctuations in wind power production. Over the weekend, a significant drop in prices is expected, with both **Saturday** and **Sunday** having the lowest average prices, around 0.9–1.2 ¢/kWh. This is mainly due to higher wind power production, which could exceed 1500 MW.

Next **Monday**, prices are expected to rise slightly again, with the average price settling around 3.5 ¢/kWh. Wind power is expected to be at a relatively low average level, which may contribute to the rise in prices.
