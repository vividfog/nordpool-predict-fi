*The start of the week will be inexpensive, but as winds ease the end of the week will get pricier and spike risk will rise; Saturday’s public holiday may somewhat soften weekend demand.*

| **Tuesday** | 4,6 | 2,2 - 9,2 | 1426 - 6796 | 2,2 |
| **Wednesday** | 3,8 | 1,4 - 5,7 | 3704 - 7148 | 3,0 |
| **Thursday** | 8,0 | 3,9 - 12,1 | 1735 - 3412 | 3,0 |
| **Friday** | 10,5 | 4,2 - 19,4 | 710 - 2008 | 2,9 |
| **Saturday** | 8,1 | 3,1 - 13,4 | 959 - 2825 | 1,8 |
| **Sunday** | 4,6 | 2,5 - 7,4 | 2183 - 3184 | 1,3 |
| **Monday** | 9,2 | 4,7 - 14,0 | 1412 - 2440 | 0,8 |

The week will start with low average prices: on **Tuesday** the average is projected at 4,6 ¢ and on **Wednesday** at 3,8 ¢. On both days, abundant wind power is expected, which would explain the moderate price level. On **Thursday** the average would rise to 8,0 ¢ as the wind weakens. **Sunday’s** price would return to a moderate level (avg. 4,6 ¢), whereas next **Monday** the average would climb to 9,2 ¢.

The risk of price spikes will stand out on **Thursday**, **Friday**, **Saturday** and next **Monday**. Thursday’s peaks will cluster around 16:00–18:00 (about 12 ¢). On Friday the highest hour is projected in the 17:00–19:00 window, up to 19,4 ¢. Friday’s very low minimum wind output (710 MW) and the week’s top price are connected: the low minimum helps explain the higher spike. Saturday is a public holiday, so demand may be lower than usual; a potential spike would center on 08:00–10:00 (up to 13,4 ¢). Next Monday the high will land around 08:00–10:00 (up to 14,0 ¢), and weak wind may support the higher price level. The cheapest hours of the week will fall on Wednesday night and early morning, when prices dip to the 1,4–2,0 ¢ range.
