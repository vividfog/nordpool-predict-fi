The beginning of the week is expected to be more expensive. Weak wind power output will lift price levels especially early in the week. On **Tuesday**, the average is forecast at 14,2 ¢ with a daily high of 23,3 ¢, and a high spike risk is indicated for individual hours between 18–20. Tuesday’s sub‑2000 MW minimum output would explain the week’s highest peak. A high spike risk is also noted on **Wednesday**, with a roughly 21,4 ¢ peak around 8–10 in the morning, and the minimum output stays below 2000 MW. On **Thursday**, the risk of isolated spikes would shift to the afternoon around 15–17, even though the maximum price would stay at 14,8 ¢. On **Friday**, spike risk would again be high, with an around 19,6 ¢ peak near the 18–20 evening hours; a minimum below 2000 MW would support the higher maximum.

For the weekend, price levels are expected to drop clearly as wind strengthens. **Saturday** is estimated at a 6,2 ¢ average and the day’s highs remain around 10 ¢. **Sunday** looks to be the week’s cheapest, with a 4,5 ¢ average and the night’s lowest hours around 1–3 at roughly 1,7 ¢. The week’s cheapest periods thus cluster in Sunday night and early morning, whereas the most expensive hours concentrate on Tuesday and Friday evenings and Wednesday morning.
