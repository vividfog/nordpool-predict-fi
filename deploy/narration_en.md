| **Wednesday** | 10,0 | 1,0 - 20,2 | 823 - 5206 | 6,4 |
| **Thursday** | 1,8 | 0,2 - 3,8 | 3484 - 6051 | 7,5 |
| **Friday** | 7,1 | 3,4 - 10,6 | 1927 - 3569 | 5,9 |
| **Saturday** | 7,5 | 4,1 - 11,4 | 1277 - 3420 | 5,2 |
| **Sunday** | 2,8 | 1,6 - 3,5 | 3099 - 5479 | 4,7 |
| **Monday** | 6,0 | 1,8 - 11,4 | 2087 - 5302 | 4,0 |
| **Tuesday** | 8,9 | 2,1 - 16,2 | 819 - 3287 | 3,7 |

Price expectations for the week will diverge clearly. **On Wednesday** the average price will rise to 10,0 ¢, and intraday variation will be large: the morning will peak at 20,2 ¢. In contrast, **on Thursday** and **Sunday** averages will drop to 1,8–2,8 ¢, and hourly prices will remain broadly low. **Friday** and **Saturday** will settle at 7,1–7,5 ¢, and **next Monday** is expected around 6,0 ¢.

Weak wind will add price pressure particularly **on Wednesday**: minimum wind output will fall to 823 MW, and the period’s highest maximum price, 20,2 ¢, will occur the same day. The risk of single-hour spikes will be notable especially between 8–10. In the evening prices will level off and fall close to 1 ¢ between 21–23.

**On Saturday** spike risk will appear in the morning and late morning, most clearly between 9–11, even though the expected max is 11,4 ¢. **On Tuesday** volatility will be pronounced: minimum wind output will drop to 819 MW and the max price will rise to 16,2 ¢. Spikes are therefore expected especially between 8–10 and again in early evening, 18–20. When a peak-hour price exceeds 15 ¢ and minimum output is clearly below 1000 MW, peaks can materialize higher than forecast.

A low price level will be supported by abundant wind **on Thursday** (average 4890 MW), keeping prices for most of the day between 0,2–3,8 ¢. **Sunday** will be similar: strong output will keep prices at 1,6–3,5 ¢. **Next Monday** the daytime price will reach 11,4 ¢ in the afternoon, but night and late evening will be clearly cheaper. This is a price forecast, and outcomes can change, especially if wind production deviates from expectations.
