| **Saturday** | 2,9 | 0,7 - 5,4 | 3005 - 4395 | 1,6 |

At the start of the week, average prices will rise as wind output remains low. **Tuesday’s** average price will be 11,7 ¢ and the peak will reach 22,5 ¢. From Wednesday onwards, a lot of wind is expected, which will push prices mostly below four cents. **Friday’s** average price will be 2,0 ¢ with a range of 0,3–3,8 ¢. **Sunday** will be a public holiday, and the average price is projected at 3,2 ¢.

The risk of price spikes will stand out on Tuesday morning from 8:00–10:00 (peak 22,5 ¢) and on Monday evening from 17:00–19:00 (16,8 ¢). A costlier hour than usual is also expected on Sunday late morning from 9:00–11:00. Very low minimum wind output, 799 MW on Tuesday and 972 MW on Monday, explains the higher prices during these hours.
