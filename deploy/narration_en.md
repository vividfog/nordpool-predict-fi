The week’s price profile will split clearly in two. The expensive phase will start on **Tuesday**, whereas toward the end of the week prices will ease clearly lower. **Wednesday** will still remain elevated, but thereafter the level will subside.

**Tuesday**’s average price will rise to 16,4 cents and the day’s maximum will reach 28,7 ¢. The risk of price spikes on individual hours will be high. The highest hours are expected in the morning around 09:00–11:00 and in the evening around 18:00–20:00. Wind power will remain very low (min 483 MW), so individual peak hours may materialize higher than forecast.

**Wednesday** will average 10,2 ¢ with a maximum of 22,4 ¢. Spike risk will concentrate in the morning around 08:00–10:00. Minimum wind output will be 793 MW, but production will strengthen clearly during the day, pushing evening prices down toward the day’s lows.

**Thursday** will shift to a very low level: the average will be 1,5 ¢ with a range of 0,2–2,8 ¢. Strong winds, 3,8–5,3 GW, will explain the low price. **Friday** will continue at a low level (avg 4,8 ¢) with winds remaining strong at 2,3–4,5 GW. **Saturday** will edge slightly higher to 5,8 cents on average, but will stay clearly below Tuesday’s and Wednesday’s readings. **Sunday** will return to a low level: the average 3,4 ¢ with a range of 1,9–4,9 ¢.

Next **Monday** the cheap spell will appear to continue, with an average of 4,6 ¢ and a range of 0,9–9,1 ¢. The priciest day of the period will be Tuesday, both by average and maximum. The cheapest hours will cluster on Thursday, when prices will stay near the 0,2–2,8 cent range for almost the whole day. The forecast may still evolve with changes in wind output, especially for individual peak hours on Tuesday and Wednesday.
