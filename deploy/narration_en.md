Price expectations for the week will be mostly low, but single peak hours will add volatility. The highest average price of the week will land on the public holiday: **Saturday** averages 7,1 ¢ with a maximum of 14,4 ¢. On Saturday, brief spikes will be most likely in the late morning, around 10:00–12:00. **Thursday** is forecast to see the week’s highest maximum price, 21,4 ¢, with a spike in the evening at 17:00–19:00. Low minimum wind output on Thursday (735 MW) will explain the higher maximum price. Saturday’s average wind output (597 MW) will be very low, which will lift the day’s average price.

Overall, on most days averages will stay below four cents: **Sunday** at 0,9 ¢, **Tuesday** 1,4 ¢, **Wednesday** 1,2 ¢ and **Friday** 1,0 ¢. Negative hours are expected on Sunday overnight at 02:00–04:00, on Wednesday night around 02:00–04:00 and on Friday overnight at 02:00–04:00. **Monday’s** average will be 4,7 ¢ and **Thursday’s** 6,6 ¢. Strong wind on Sunday, Tuesday and Friday will support low prices.
