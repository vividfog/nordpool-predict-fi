The electricity price forecast for the coming week shows clear daily differences. Prices will fluctuate noticeably between individual hours, with both negative prices and high spikes in the mix. Particularly on **Saturday**, price differences will stand out strongly, as the lowest hourly price drops to 0.6 cents, while the highest peaks as high as 18 cents. This price spike will occur during Saturday morning between 9 and 11, when electricity prices might rise significantly higher compared to other hours.

**Sunday**, on the other hand, will stand out as the week's clearly most affordable day, with an average negative price of -0.7 cents. Sunday's hourly prices are forecasted to remain negative throughout the entire day, consistently below zero. The lowest prices will occur on Sunday afternoon between 12 and 15, dropping to around -1.5 cents.

On **Monday**, negative hourly prices will also appear during the night and early morning, but prices will rise back to positive territory as the day progresses. Despite this, Monday's average price will remain very low, at about half a cent per kilowatt-hour.

From Tuesday to Friday, price levels will rise slightly from the very low Sunday and Monday figures, but still remain affordable. The average prices for these days will hover around one to two cents per kilowatt-hour. After Saturday, the week's highest prices will occur on Thursday, when the maximum price reaches 4.5 cents in the evening between 19 and 21.

Overall, the upcoming week will offer electricity users varying situations: notable Saturday morning spikes and exceptionally affordable Sunday prices. Negative prices at the beginning of the week and slightly rising prices towards the end of the week will keep the price development diverse.
