*Electricity price expectations for the upcoming week vary significantly, influenced by fluctuations in wind power and maintenance outages. Friday is predicted to be the most expensive day of the week, while prices may drop considerably on Sunday.*

There is an ongoing maintenance outage at the Loviisa 2 nuclear power plant, which began on 17 August 2025 at 04:00 and is expected to end on 6 September 2025 at 00:00. The maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of the forecast as there is limited training data available for maintenance periods.

The forecast was updated on Thursday at 12:06.

Electricity price expectations for the coming week vary significantly day by day. **Friday** is expected to be the most expensive day, with an average price rising to 14.7 ¢. On Friday, price fluctuations are significant, with the highest price potentially reaching up to 25.2 ¢, which may be due to low wind power production during the morning. **Saturday** is expected to see lower prices, with an average price of 10.2 ¢. On Sunday, electricity prices may decrease significantly, with an average price of only 3.6 ¢, likely due to abundant wind power exceeding the 3000 MW mark.

At the start of the week, **Monday** prices are expected to remain moderate at 5.2 ¢. With wind power production at a high level, prices are expected to remain low. **Tuesday** and **Wednesday** average prices are 4.5 ¢ and 6.2 ¢, which is reasonable despite the ongoing nuclear maintenance outage. By the end of the week on **Thursday**, the average price is expected to be 8.3 ¢, possibly due to lower wind power production.

Towards the end of the week, the risk of price spikes is high, especially on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, when prices may rise significantly during certain hours. This may particularly affect morning and evening hours, as indicated by the Friday forecast for 8-10 and 18-20.
