The upcoming week presents a diverse range of electricity prices. **Monday** and **Friday** will maintain relatively low prices, and **Saturday** is expected to see even negative prices at times, making it the cheapest day of the week with an average price below one cent. This is supported by strong wind power exceeding 4000 MW.

**Tuesday** and **Wednesday** stand out with significantly higher price expectations, with Wednesday's anticipated average price reaching 10.7 ¬¢. The risk of price spikes is high on both days, with Wednesday potentially reaching a maximum of 20.4 ¬¢. The low minimum wind power production on Wednesday, 910 MW, combined with high prices explains this.

**Thursday's** price level falls between Tuesday and Wednesday, but the risk of price spikes remains high. Wind power production remains moderate but is insufficient to completely smooth out price fluctuations. As the weekend approaches, **Friday's** prices drop back towards early-week levels, with high wind power production helping to lower prices.

The weekend, particularly **Saturday**, brings low prices, partly due to strong winds. Sunday continues this trend, with electricity prices expected to remain low throughout the day. This provides consumers with an opportunity to take advantage of low prices over the weekend.
