Price expectations for the week will be mostly moderate. Several days will average under four cents, and clearly elevated averages will be rare. **Monday** and **Tuesday** will average 6,7 and 6,2 cents, while the cheapest day of the week is expected to be Saturday at 2,0 cents.

Tuesday’s intraday variation will be large. The day’s peak will fall in the morning, and individual hours are assessed to carry elevated spike risk: the most expensive window will most likely be around 08:00–10:00, when the forecast peak is 17,3 ¢. Individual hours could exceed this. On the same day, wind power minimum output will drop to 1 680 megawatts, which explains the higher maximum price compared with other days.

**On Sunday** and **on Wednesday** the price level will remain low throughout the day. Wednesday’s range will be 0,4–4,0 ¢, and on Sunday prices will mostly hover near 3 cents, with the day’s upper bound at 4,4 ¢. Both days will be supported by strong wind generation, which pushes prices down.

The week’s cheapest hours will fall on **Saturday** during the late night and early morning, when prices dip to 0,1–0,5 cents. At the other end, Tuesday morning stands out as an exception as described above. The other days will run in clearly narrower price bands without notable single-hour peaks.
