Price expectations for the week will be clearly split. On **Saturday** the average will stay at 3,7 ¢ and hourly prices will remain between 1,5–5,1 ¢. On **Sunday** the daily average will rise to 7,1 ¢, and on **Monday** a level of 7,7 ¢ will be expected. The clearly more expensive days will fall on **Tuesday**, **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, with averages ranging from 12,1 to 14,1 ¢. Of these, Thursday will stand out with the highest average at 14,1 ¢ as well as a 20,4 ¢ maximum. Saturday’s low level will be supported by strong wind generation, whereas weak winds from Tuesday through Friday will show up as elevated daily averages.

Spike risk will be highlighted only on some days. On **Sunday** the highest hourly price will likely occur in the evening between 17:00–19:00. On **Tuesday** the peak will set in the evening 16:00–18:00. On **Wednesday** the top will hit the morning hours 7:00–9:00, and on **Thursday** the late morning 8:00–10:00. On **Friday** the high will also fall in the evening around 17:00–19:00. What these days have in common is a low minimum for wind power, below 2000 MW, which explains higher-than-usual intraday maximum prices.
