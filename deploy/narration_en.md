The week’s price path is set to split between low and mid-level days, with one clearly higher day standing out. The lowest averages are expected on **Thursday** (2.7 ¢) and **Sunday** (2.9 ¢), aligning with stronger wind output. On **Monday**, **Wednesday** and **Saturday**, averages are projected around 5–7 cents, whereas **Friday** is set to climb into the evening above 11 cents, with the peak settling between 16:00–20:00 at 11.8–13.1 ¢.

The clearest exception will be **Tuesday**: the average is expected to reach 11.0 ¢ and the day’s maximum 17.3 ¢. The spike is projected for the evening around 17:00–19:00, while the morning at 08:00–10:00 may also approach 15 ¢. The backdrop is weak wind: minimum output falls to 759 MW and the daily average wind stays at 1831 MW, which explains the higher maximum and elevated daily mean. Toward the end of the week, wind is set to strengthen, supporting Thursday’s and Sunday’s low ranges of 0.8–4.7 ¢ and 1.5–4.6 ¢.
