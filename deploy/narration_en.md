The upcoming week brings varied price expectations for electricity on the market. **Monday** stands out as the most expensive day of the week, with an average price rising to 12.9 cents and peak prices potentially reaching up to 23.0 cents. This can partly be attributed to low wind power production, which falls to just 231 MW in the morning hours. The risk of price spikes is particularly notable during the afternoon and evening hours, from 18:00 to 20:00.

On **Tuesday**, the price level significantly drops, with the average price expected to be 7.2 cents. This is partly due to substantial wind power production, exceeding 2500 MW during the day. However, price spikes are also anticipated on Tuesday, particularly in the morning from 8:00 to 10:00 and in the evening from 18:00 to 20:00.

In the middle of the week, on **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, prices settle at more moderate levels, with average prices of 6.2 and 6.8 cents, respectively. During these days, wind power production is relatively stable, and no significant price fluctuations are expected.

The most affordable day of the week is **Friday**, when the average price drops to 4.0 cents. Wind power production is high on this day, partially explaining the lower price level.

**Saturday** again brings a slight increase in prices, with the average price at 7.7 cents. There is a risk of price spikes, particularly during the morning and afternoon hours.
