The weekend will look exceptionally inexpensive. **Saturday** will see the average price stay below one cent, and wind will range widely, supporting low prices. **Sunday** is expected to remain cheap. In the early hours prices will likely even turn negative, around 3–5, before daytime levels rise to a few cents.

**Monday** will lift the average to about 7 cents. Weaker wind than over the weekend may support higher prices, and a risk of single-hour spikes is noted. The highest hours will cluster in the early evening, likely around 17–19, when prices may exceed 12 cents.

The week’s priciest stretches will land in the early week. **Tuesday** will push the average to 11,1 cents with a projected maximum of 25,1 ¢. The day’s minimum wind output drops very low, to 537 megawatts, which clearly explains the higher peak price. Spike risk will be high, with the peak most likely in the early evening around 17–19. **Wednesday** will hold the average high at 11,3 cents, and the intraday maximum will reach 19,5 cents in weak-wind conditions. Elevated prices will again concentrate in the afternoon and early evening, roughly 16–18.

Later in the week pressure will ease. **Thursday** will see the average fall clearly lower, to about 4,8 cents. A single pricier window will likely appear in the morning around 7–9, but the day will remain cheaper overall. **Friday** will lift the average back near 10 cents. The risk of single-hour spikes will be high, with a morning hump around 8–10; a second pricier window may appear in the early evening around 17–19.

In the weekly picture the start will be cheap, Tuesday–Wednesday will get expensive with weak wind, and late week will settle, though Friday will again bring distinctly higher moments. Tuesday’s 25,1-cent peak will stand out as the week’s clearest outlier.
