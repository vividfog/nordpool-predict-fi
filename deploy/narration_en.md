In the price forecast for the week, **Monday** stands out with higher expected prices. The average price for the day is 3.5 cents per kilowatt-hour, with a maximum price potentially rising to 6.6 cents. This is due to both lower wind power availability and possible price spikes at certain hours, especially in the morning around 8 AM and in the evening between 6 PM and 8 PM. On **Tuesday**, the price expectations drop significantly, with an average price of only 0.9 cents. There is plenty of wind power available on Tuesday, which partly explains the lower prices.

On **Wednesday**, prices are slightly higher than on Tuesday, but still remain at a reasonable level, with an average price of 2.0 cents. There is a risk of price spikes, so there could be larger fluctuations during some hours. **Thursday** sees the average price rise to 2.6 cents, with a continued risk of price spikes. Friday's forecasted average price is 3.2 cents, and the risk of price spikes remains.

**Saturday** brings slightly lower prices, with an average price of 1.9 cents. The wind power supply remains reasonable, and no significant price spikes are expected. On **Sunday**, the average price further decreases to 1.5 cents, but the risk of price spikes is still present, especially in the evening. The week offers varying prices, with Monday standing out as the most expensive day, while Tuesday is clearly the cheapest.
