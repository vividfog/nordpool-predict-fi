The electricity price forecast shows notable variation throughout the week. At the start of the weekend, significantly higher price spikes will occur, whereas prices from Sunday and early next week will remain low, occasionally even negative.

On **Friday** and **Saturday**, prices will rise sharply during certain hours. On **Friday**, the highest price is expected in the evening between 19:00 and 21:00, when electricity prices may exceed 17 cents per kilowatt-hour. Also, on **Saturday** morning between 08:00 and 10:00, prices could peak above 21 cents. On both days, wind power production will be very low at its minimum‚Äîonly 282 MW on Friday and 134 MW on Saturday‚Äîwhich partly explains these high price spikes.

On **Sunday**, prices are expected to drop significantly. The day's average price will be only 1.4 cents, and during certain hours, electricity prices could even become negative. On Sunday afternoon between 12:00 and 14:00, the forecasted electricity price is -0.7 cents. This is primarily due to very high wind power generation, consistently staying between approximately 1773 and 2394 MW throughout the day.

At the beginning of the next week, on **Monday** and **Tuesday**, electricity prices will remain low, with averages below four cents. These days will also feature some negative-price hours during early morning and night. For example, on **Monday** between 03:00 and 05:00, the price will drop to -0.7 cents, with wind power production exceeding 2600 MW at that time.

On **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, prices will rise slightly but remain relatively low. The highest prices on Wednesday will just surpass five cents, with no significant price spikes expected. Similarly, on **Thursday**, electricity prices will remain moderate, ranging from 0.5 to 6.2 cents.

Thus, the week's electricity price development will be clearly divided: the beginning of the weekend will witness the highest fluctuations and price spikes, while from Sunday onwards, prices will significantly decrease and remain moderate.
