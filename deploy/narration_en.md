*The upcoming week's electricity price forecast shows considerable fluctuations: on Thursday morning, prices may rise exceptionally high, while during the weekend electricity will briefly be priced negatively. The variable production of wind power significantly explains these large price differences.*

The Olkiluoto 2 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance, which began on 25 May 2025 at 18:00 and is expected to end on 23 June 2025 at 19:00. Additionally, production at Olkiluoto 3 is reduced, with an availability rate of 66.2 percent from 23 June 2025 at 06:00 to 25 June 2025 at 01:00. These maintenance operations may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as training data from maintenance periods is limited.

The price forecast was updated on Monday at 14:24.

Electricity prices will fluctuate significantly throughout the week. Especially **Thursday** stands out clearly with a higher average price, forecasted at 6,2 cents per kilowatt-hour. On Thursday, prices during individual hours may rise exceptionally high, with the day's maximum reaching up to 13,8 cents between 7:00 and 9:00 in the morning. The risk of price spikes is markedly elevated on Thursday, largely due to very low wind levels in the morning hours. At that time, wind power production will bottom out at approximately 429 MW, clearly below the normal level.

On **Friday**, prices will return to more moderate levels, although individual price spikes may still occur. The day's average price, however, remains low at about two cents per kilowatt-hour. **Saturday** will also offer affordable electricity prices, and prices may even turn negative during the nighttime hours. Saturday's average price will remain below one cent, even though the risk of hourly price spikes still exists.

On **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, electricity prices will remain very low. Tuesday's average price will be below half a cent, and Wednesday's average price will be around one and a half cents. On Wednesday, plenty of wind power will be available, helping maintain the low price level.

The forecasts for Sunday and next Monday also indicate moderate price levels. Sunday's average price will be two cents, and on Monday the average price will rise slightly closer to three cents. These days may experience occasional hourly price spikes, particularly on Monday evening between 18:00 and 20:00, when electricity prices could reach seven cents.

Overall, the coming week will show varied price development in the electricity market. Thursday's notable price spike is the week's most prominent exception, while weekend nights offer affordable and occasionally negatively priced electricity. The variability in wind power production explains much of these price fluctuations, with changes in wind generation directly reflecting in rising and falling prices.
