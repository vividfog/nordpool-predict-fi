Electricity price expectations will remain mostly low over the weekend and at the start of the week. **Friday** average price will be 2,8 ¢, and as the day is a public holiday demand will likely be lower than usual. **Saturday** average will settle at 1,1 ¢, and strong wind supports the low level. **Sunday** average is 1,9 ¢. **Monday** at 2,9 ¢ and **Tuesday** at 3,7 ¢ will keep prices still below four cents. **Wednesday** average rises to 5,4 ¢ and the day's highest hour is 10,4 ¢, skewed to the evening.

**Thursday** will be clearly expensive: the average is 12,5 ¢ and the daily peak 21,5 ¢. A high risk of price spikes during individual hours is indicated for Thursday; the peak is estimated around 16–18. The rise is explained by weak wind: the wind power minimum drops to 658 MW that day, and the low output is a clear contributor to the high maximum price. In addition, temperatures will be -7,4 °C, which can raise consumption even though the day is a public holiday.
