The coming week will bring varying electricity prices. **Sunday** and **Monday** are expected to have higher average prices, 9.9¢ and 10.2¢. Both days carry a high risk of price spikes, especially during morning and evening hours. **Monday** is forecasted to reach peak prices of up to 26.0¢, which could be due to weak wind power and the maintenance of Loviisa 2.

The cheapest periods are expected on **Saturday** and **Tuesday**, with average prices remaining below 7¢. **Tuesday’s** minimum price is only 2.1¢, indicating strong wind power. This could stabilize the price throughout the day, although no price spikes are anticipated.

Towards the end of the week, prices stabilize, but particularly on **Thursday**, price spikes are expected in the afternoon. Average wind power production is relatively low, contributing to the increased prices.
