Next week's electricity market will see fluctuating price trends. **Friday** offers some of the lowest prices of the week, with an average price of 0.3 ¢/kWh. Wind power production is expected to be relatively high, supporting these low prices. **Saturday** continues with affordable rates, but significant price variations are expected on Sunday. Sunday's maximum price is predicted to rise to as high as 16.5 cents, with potential price spikes in certain hours. This is partly due to the minimum wind power production falling below 1000 MW.

**On Monday**, prices stabilize slightly, with an average price of 1.8 ¢/kWh. Tuesday's average price rises to 2.9 ¢, but the risk of price spikes is low. **Wednesday** sees a slight decrease in the average price to 2.5 cents, and Thursday maintains a similar trend, although the maximum price could reach 9.6 ¢.

Thus, the weekend is expected to witness considerable volatility in electricity prices, especially on Sunday, prompting consumers to monitor their electricity usage closely during the weekend.
