In the coming week, electricity price trends are expected to vary between days. On **Saturday**, price expectations are high, with an average price of 10.2 ¬¢/kWh, and a maximum reaching 19.9 cents. High prices may be pronounced in the morning and evening, particularly between 09:00 and 20:00. With wind power production at its lowest on Saturday, the risk of price spikes is significant.

On **Sunday**, the situation is expected to calm significantly, with an average expected price of 3.4 ¬¢/kWh. Wind power production is anticipated to be high on Sunday, partly explaining the lower price expectations. On **Monday**, prices are expected to remain moderate, with an average price of 2.6 ¬¢/kWh, and no price spikes are predicted.

**Tuesday** is expected to see an upward trend in electricity prices. The day's average price rises to 6.4 ¬¢/kWh, and the maximum reaches 18.8 cents. The price increase on Tuesday may partly be explained by low wind power production, especially in the morning and evening hours. On **Wednesday**, price trends continue in line with Tuesday, with an average price of 7.6 ¬¢/kWh and a maximum of 16.0 cents.

Towards the end of the week, prices are expected to drop again. On **Thursday**, the average price is 2.8 ¬¢/kWh, and on **Friday**, the expected price is only 0.6 ¬¢/kWh, making Friday the most affordable day of the week. This is mainly due to high wind power production, which pushes prices down.
