The week will look inexpensive: on most days the average price will remain below four cents. **Tuesday** and **Wednesday** will form a soft start, with prices dropping very low and briefly turning negative. Negative prices are expected on Wednesday night around 02:00â€“04:00. **Thursday** will continue in the same vein, and short negative stretches are anticipated in the Thursday night as well, around 02:00â€“04:00. The low price level will be supported by strong wind output early in the week.

Toward midweek and into the weekend, the level will rise moderately. **Fridayâ€™s** average will still stay under four cents, although some evening hours may reach close to eight cents. On **Saturday** wind will weaken clearly to an average below 2,500 MW, which will show up as a somewhat higher price range. Saturday also carries a risk of isolated price spikes; they may fall around midday, roughly 09:00â€“11:00.

**Sunday** will ease back to a slightly lower level. The lowest hours will hover right around zero, and the upper end is expected at a bit over seven cents. The variation within the week will remain fairly moderate until the change early next week becomes more pronounced.

The most distinct day will be next **Monday**, with the average forecast at 6,8 Â¢ and the dayâ€™s maximum at 11,0 Â¢. The dayâ€™s minimum wind output, 1629 MW, will drop clearly below 2000 MW. This low baseline output helps explain the higher peak on Monday. Monday is also marked with a risk of isolated spikes, expected especially in the morning around 07:00â€“09:00. Levels will also stay elevated before noon.

Realized prices may still deviate from the forecast, especially if wind conditions change.
