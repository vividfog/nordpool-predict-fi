*The electricity market this week is expected to see fluctuating prices, with potential price spikes on Tuesday and Wednesday, but the weekend offers consumers low prices due to increased wind power availability.*

**Loviisa 1** nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance. The maintenance outage began on September 6th and is expected to end on October 2nd. This may affect the accuracy of the forecast, as there is limited training data available for periods of maintenance outages.

The forecast was updated on Monday at 09:08.

The price development for the week is varied, with **Wednesday** expecting significantly higher prices, with an average price of 11.6 cents. The highest price forecasted for this day is 25.6 cents, which might be explained by low wind power production, reaching a minimum of 854 MW. **Tuesday** is also expected to have significant price fluctuations, with a maximum daily price forecasted at 21.8 cents. Price spikes on Tuesday and Wednesday may occur during morning and evening hours.

Towards the end of the week, prices drop significantly, and **Saturday** and **Sunday** are expected to have very low prices, with average prices at 0.2 and 0.1 cents. During these days, wind power is more abundant, partly explaining the low prices. **Friday** also sees low prices, with no significant price spikes expected.

Next **Monday**, prices rise slightly from the weekend's levels but remain moderate. The average price is expected to be 2.7 cents, and the broad range of wind power production may impact potential price adjustments from the forecasted levels.
