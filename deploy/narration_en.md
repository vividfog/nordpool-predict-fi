The upcoming week's electricity price forecast appears variable, but prices are expected to remain mostly affordable. **Saturday** is projected to have the lowest prices, with an average price of only 2.1 ¢/kWh. **Sunday** and **Wednesday** are also expected to have low average prices, at 2.7 ¢ and 2.3 ¢/kWh respectively. On Sunday, there might be negative hourly prices early in the afternoon, which is unusual.

The highest price expectations are on **Tuesday**, with an average daily price forecasted at 4.1 ¢/kWh. During this time, wind power production is expected to be at a low level, partially explaining the higher price forecasts. **Monday** and **Friday** are also expected to have slightly higher prices compared to the weekend, but average prices remain below five cents.

There is a risk of price spikes on several days, particularly on **Thursday**, **Friday**, and **Monday**. On these days, prices may rise significantly during individual hours, especially in the evening. For example, on **Thursday**, the highest hourly prices could occur between 18:00 and 20:00.
