The coming week's electricity price forecast indicates affordable average prices. Prices will mostly vary below five cents, and none of the average daily prices will approach an expensive level. However, there will be clear fluctuations between days, notably reflected in minimum hourly prices that occasionally dip to negative levels.

The lowest average price of the week will occur on **Sunday**, averaging -1.0 cents per kilowatt-hour. On that day, the week's lowest single-hour price (-1.9 ¢) will be observed between 13:00 and 15:00 in the afternoon. Negative prices reflect situations where electricity production exceeds demand, typically occurring when wind power generation is abundant and consumption is low.

Price variation will be evident throughout the week. While **Sunday** will have exceptionally affordable electricity, on **Wednesday** prices will rise to the week's highest hourly value, 5.1 cents, between 16:00 and 18:00. Wednesday's average price (2.2 ¢) will also be the highest of the week, yet it remains affordable. Similarly, on **Saturday**, a higher maximum price is expected, with electricity costing up to 5.0 cents between 19:00 and 21:00.

The risk of price spikes for individual hours exists on several days, especially in the mornings and evenings. For example, on **Tuesday**, the highest price, 4.2 cents, will occur late in the evening between 21:00 and 23:00. Similarly, on **Thursday** and **Friday**, prices may momentarily rise slightly higher, although average daily prices remain moderate.

Wind power production will clearly influence prices during the week. On **Monday** and **Sunday**, higher than average wind power generation will lead to noticeably lower prices and even negative hourly prices. In contrast, on Wednesday and Saturday, lower wind power production will temporarily increase electricity's maximum prices. On Wednesday, wind power production will fall to a low of 1077 MW, partially explaining the higher peak price observed that day.

Overall, electricity prices for the coming week will remain very reasonable. Apart from a few isolated periods, consumers can expect to benefit from affordable market electricity.
