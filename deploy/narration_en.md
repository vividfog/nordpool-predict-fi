| **Tuesday** | 9,1 | 5,1 - 12,9 | 1108 - 2909 | 1,5 |

| **Friday** | 1,4 | 0,3 - 2,7 | 4712 - 6321 | 1,0 |

The week’s price pattern will be mixed. **Saturday** and **Sunday** will stay low, with averages around 2–3 cents and most hours in the 0–5 ¢ range. **Monday** will stand out as clearly the priciest day: the average will be 9,5 ¢ and the day’s peak 16,4 ¢. Wind power minimum output will be only 861 MW that day, which explains the higher maximum. A high risk of price spikes is indicated for Monday; based on the forecast, peaks will occur in the morning 07:00–09:00 and especially in the evening 17:00–19:00, when individual hours may rise above the indicated levels. **Tuesday** will also carry a spike risk, with higher hours around midday 10:00–12:00 and early evening 17:00–19:00; the day’s top price will be 12,9 ¢.

Midweek will ease. **Wednesday** and **Thursday** are public holidays, which may nudge prices lower; averages will sit around 6–7 cents. **Friday** will be clearly the cheapest: an average of 1,4 ¢ and a range of 0,3–2,7 ¢. Wind power is forecast to be plentiful then, supporting broadly low price levels.
