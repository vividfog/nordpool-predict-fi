The week will vary clearly. **Thursday’s** average price will dip to 1,5 ¢ and **Wednesday’s** to 3,8 ¢, making these the week’s cheapest days. A pricier overall picture will be seen on **Friday**, **Saturday** and next **Monday**, where the average will settle around 11 ¢. **Sunday** (6,9 ¢) and **Tuesday** (7,0 ¢) will stay in the middle range.

**Thursday** night will bring an exception: prices will turn negative at 1–3. The day will otherwise be unusually low, supported by strong wind generation through the day.

The highest peak is expected on **Friday**, with the top hour reaching about 21,9 ¢ at 10–12. This will be explained by a very low wind power minimum, dipping to 509 MW. **Saturday** will also show an accentuated morning spike, roughly at 8–10, topping at 17,7 ¢. Intraday variation will be clear as winds ease.

After the weekend, prices will rise again: next **Monday** the spike will land in the evening, around 17–19, with a maximum of 19,0 ¢. On **Tuesday**, the morning hours (8–10) are expected to exceed 15 ¢, but late evening will fall clearly, locally towards 2–4 ¢. **Wednesday** will return to a distinctly cheaper setting, helped by abundant wind.
