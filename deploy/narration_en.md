*Electricity prices will see clear fluctuations in the coming days, moving from extremely affordable levels on Friday to higher rates over the weekend and into next week; particularly on Saturday, significant price variations are expected, driven by substantial differences in wind power production.*

Electricity prices will vary significantly in the upcoming days. According to forecasts, the most affordable day is **Friday**, when the average electricity price will drop to just 0.4 cents per kilowatt-hour. Particularly during night and morning hours, prices could even turn negative, reaching as low as -0.2 cents. Friday's low prices are largely explained by strong wind power generation, peaking at over 6000 megawatts during the highest production hours.

On **Saturday**, the situation will change notably as the average electricity price quickly climbs above six cents. A large variation within the day will see peak prices soar to 16.5 cents between 19:00‚Äì21:00. This is significantly influenced by low wind power production, dropping to a minimum of around 200 megawatts. Thus, the risk of price spikes is notably high on Saturday, especially in the evening hours.

Price fluctuations will continue on **Sunday** and **Monday** as well. Sunday's average price will settle at about 4.6 cents, but prices will peak near 11 cents in the morning between 8:00‚Äì10:00. Wind power generation at that time remains very low, around 150 megawatts, explaining the higher prices. Monday's average will be slightly higher at 5.1 cents, with maximum prices surpassing 10 cents in the evening hours between 18:00‚Äì20:00. Again, relatively weak wind power production contributes to this situation.

On **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, price levels will slightly decrease compared to the beginning of the week, with both days averaging around four cents. Tuesday's price fluctuations will remain moderate, staying below seven cents at their peak. Wednesday will see slightly more variation, with a mid-week high of 8.5 cents expected between 8:00‚Äì10:00 in the morning.

Prices will rise again on **Thursday**, averaging around six cents. During evening hours between 19:00‚Äì21:00, prices will peak at about 11 cents per kilowatt-hour. Minimum wind power production will remain relatively low on Thursday, partially contributing to the higher electricity prices.
