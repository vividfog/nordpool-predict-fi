The starting week brings varying electricity price expectations. On **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, larger price fluctuations are expected, with Thursday's average price rising to 5.4 ¬¢. The maximum price on Thursday, 11.2 ¬¢, might be explained by low wind power production, which only reaches 723 MW. It would be wise to closely monitor the price development on these days due to potential price spikes.

The most affordable prices will be seen on **Sunday**, where the average price remains at 0.8 ¬¢. This is partly due to strong winds, pushing production above 3000 MW. Prices are also low on **Monday**, with an average price of 1.1 ¬¢, thanks to abundant wind power production.

**Friday's** prices are moderate, but individual hours might experience spikes. This is related to fluctuations in wind power production, as production varies significantly throughout the day. **Saturday's** average price is also modest at 2.4 ¬¢, but prices are expected to vary throughout the day, possibly resulting in price spikes.

The beginning of the week is thus affordable, but towards the end of the week, price expectations rise. Variations in wind power production and their impacts on price development make the week interesting to follow.
