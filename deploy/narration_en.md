In the upcoming week's electricity price expectations, **Saturday** stands out with an average price rising to 15 ¢ per kilowatt-hour. This day is also forecasted to have the highest maximum price at 28.6 ¢/kWh, due to low wind power production, expected to be at a minimum of just 472 MW. This might lead to price spikes, particularly in the morning, around 8-10 AM. **Sunday** follows with an average price of 10.1 ¢, and the risk of price spikes is again present.

The week begins with relatively low prices, as **Tuesday** offers an affordable average of 1.5 ¢/kWh. This is due to strong wind power production, which stabilizes the prices. **Wednesday** sees a slight rise to an average of 4.7 ¢. Despite the wide price range, there is no risk of price spikes.

**Thursday** and **Friday** average prices are 5.4 ¢ and 6.6 ¢, respectively. These days are expected to have price spikes, but they are likely to be moderate compared to the weekend peaks. **Monday**'s average price settles at 6.2 ¢, with potential price spikes likely in the evening, around 7-9 PM.

The week's price expectations vary greatly, with the weekend particularly appearing as an expensive period. Electricity users should prepare for fluctuations and potential price spikes, especially over the weekend.
