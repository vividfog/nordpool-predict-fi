*The weekend will bring broadly low electricity prices, but from Tuesday to Friday costs will rise and single-hour spike risks will stand out in evenings and mornings.*

| **Wednesday** | 12,6 | 5,5 - 21,3 | 801 - 1339 | 5,1 |
| **Thursday** | 14,4 | 5,0 - 28,5 | 251 - 1185 | 4,8 |

The week will start with low prices. On **Saturday** the average is expected at 2,2 cents and on **Sunday** at 1,9 cents. During Sunday night and early morning, prices will briefly dip below zero (around 03:00–04:00), pulling the day’s average down. The affordability on these days will be explained by abundant wind power, which will be clearly stronger than usual over the weekend.

On **Monday** the average will rise to 6,0 cents, still clearly below the pricier part of the week. The real shift will begin from **Tuesday** onward, when a more expensive stretch will set in: Tuesday’s average will be 10,2 ¢, **Wednesday’s** 12,6 ¢, **Thursday’s** 14,4 ¢ and **Friday’s** 14,2 ¢. The rise will be supported by weakening wind output: especially on Thursday and Friday the minimum wind production will stay well below 1000 MW, which is tied to the high maximum prices on those days.

The most notable outlier will be **Thursday**, with the highest hourly price forecast at 28,5 cents. Intraday variation will be strong, with prices climbing toward the maximum from the afternoon onward. On **Friday** the maximum will also be high at 23,5 cents. On these days the minimum wind level (251 MW on Thursday, 190 MW on Friday) will be exceptionally low, which explains the higher peaks compared with other days.

The risk of price spikes in individual hours will be elevated toward the end of the week. On **Tuesday** the peak will most likely land between 16:00–18:00 (centered around 17:00). On **Wednesday** the peak will hit the morning, around 07:00–09:00 (centered around 08:00). On **Thursday** the risks will skew to the evening 17:00–19:00 (centered around 18:00), and on **Friday** to 16:00–18:00 (centered around 17:00). At other times, prices will vary more moderately with intraday production.

In summary, the week will split in two: the weekend will be broadly inexpensive, whereas from Tuesday to Friday prices will be high, at times with sharp morning and evening peaks.
