Price expectations will stay low at the start of the period. On **Saturday**, the average price will be 0,1 ¢ and the range is expected to be about 0,0–0,4 ¢. From **Sunday** to **Tuesday**, daily averages are projected between 2,0–3,6 ¢, and hourly prices will mostly remain below 5 ¢. The cheapest hours will fall on the weekend and in the night and morning periods early in the week.

Levels will rise clearly on **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, as individual hours reach 9–11,2 ¢, even though daily averages will stay below 6 ¢. **Friday’s** average will rise to 10,2 ¢ and the day’s peak to 18,5 ¢; the spike risk for individual hours will be high, especially at 16:00–18:00. Friday’s unusual peak will be explained by a very low wind-power minimum output (876 MW), which is well below 2000 MW.
