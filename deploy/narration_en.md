Next week, electricity prices will vary considerably, especially on **Friday**, when the average price will rise to 9.8 cents, with a peak reaching up to 21.9 cents. This makes Friday the most expensive day of the week. These high prices are partly influenced by the low minimum wind power production, which will remain at 919 megawatts.

At the beginning of the week, on **Monday**, the electricity average price will settle at 3.3 cents, the lowest of the week. Monday is expected to be more stable without price spikes. **Saturday**, on the other hand, will stand out for the risk of high price spikes, particularly during the evening hours when prices could rise above 11 cents.

On **Tuesday** and **Saturday**, the risk of price spikes is significant, especially during the morning and evening hours. **Sunday** will, in turn, settle at a price level close to the week's average, but price peaks are possible.

Average prices will fluctuate throughout the week, with Friday's high average price standing out. Variations in wind power production influence price trends, but overall, wind power will be available at a fairly normal level.
