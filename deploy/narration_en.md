Price levels will remain moderate at the start of the week. The lowest average price will be on Sunday, about 3,0 ¢. The clear outlier of the week will be Friday, when the average will rise to 10,7 ¢ and the day’s high will reach 18,7 ¢. On Friday, wind power’s minimum output will be very low (853 MW), which will explain the week’s highest maximum price. On Saturday, the average will settle around 6,0 ¢. It will be a public holiday, so demand may ease in places.

The risk of price spikes will stand out on Friday afternoon, with the peak expected around 16:00–18:00. On Saturday, a possible morning uptick will appear around 9:00–11:00. Otherwise, the price trend will stay more even in the early-week days, and Sunday’s night and morning hours will hover near zero. As winds strengthen on several days, prices will remain moderate, but Friday’s weak output will lift both the day’s average and individual hourly prices clearly above the rest of the week.
