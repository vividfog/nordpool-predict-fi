| **Tuesday** | 12,5 | 5,6 - 24,8 | 479 - 1836 | 4,7 |
| **Wednesday** | 13,4 | 6,0 - 22,6 | 824 - 1032 | 5,1 |

Over the weekend, a rather low price level will be expected. **Saturday’s** average price will be 2,5 ¢, and **Sunday’s** 4,2 ¢. **Friday’s** 6,8 ¢ will act as a transition into the start of the week, when prices will rise.

At the start of next week, prices will climb. **Monday’s** average will be 8,0 ¢, followed by a pricier stretch: **Tuesday** 12,5 ¢, **Wednesday** 13,4 ¢ and **Thursday** 15,4 ¢. High daily peaks will be seen especially on days like Wednesday and Thursday, with intraday highs exceeding 20 ¢. Thursday will stand out with the week’s highest maximum, 26,6 ¢. On these days, minimum wind output will fall very low (below 1000 MW), which will explain the elevated peaks. On **Tuesday** the minimum will also be exceptionally low (479 MW), reflected in the 24,8 ¢ high.

A spike risk will be flagged for several days. On **Friday**, individual evening hours could rise notably, most likely at 18:00–20:00. On **Monday**, the focus will be on the evening, around 17:00–19:00. On **Tuesday**, the risk will be high; the largest peak will likely fall in the evening at 17:00–19:00. On **Wednesday**, the risk will be elevated both in the morning at 08:00–10:00 and in the evening at 17:00–19:00. On **Thursday**, the highest probability will land in the evening at 17:00–19:00, and the anticipated peak will be the week’s highest.

The cheapest individual hours of the week will fall on the weekend. On **Saturday** evening at 21:00–23:00, levels of 0,8–1,1 ¢ will be anticipated. In **Sunday’s** early night at 01:00–03:00, prices will stay around 0,6–1,7 ¢. Moving into weekdays, night and morning hours will generally be more moderate, while evenings will lift daily averages, especially from Tuesday to Thursday.
