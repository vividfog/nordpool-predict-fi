Electricity prices in the coming days will vary considerably. The week's cheapest day will be **Sunday**, when the average price clearly falls into negative territory at around -1.1 cents. Sunday will also record the week's lowest hourly price, as between 12â€“14 o'clock electricity prices will drop as low as -1.9 cents.

The week's highest electricity prices will occur on **Thursday**, when the day's average price rises to 2.4 cents, and the peak hourly price reaches as high as 5.5 cents between 19â€“21 o'clock in the evening. Thursday's high maximum price is partially explained by wind power production dropping to a low level, with its minimum falling below 1500 MW.

Significant price variation will also occur on **Monday**, when electricity prices fluctuate from the night's lowest of -1.6 cents up to five cents during evening peak hours. The highest prices will occur between 20â€“22 o'clock. Similar price variation continues on **Tuesday**, although prices will remain somewhat more moderate, ranging from -0.5 cents to 2.3 cents during daytime and evening hours.

On **Wednesday** and **Friday**, average electricity prices will remain close to one cent per kilowatt-hour, but intra-day price variation will still be substantial. On Wednesday, prices will bottom out at -1.0 cents in the early morning and peak at 1.7 cents late in the evening. On Friday, price movements will be somewhat narrower, between -0.4 cents and 3.1 cents.

**Saturday**, which begins the weekend, will hold an average price level close to zero, with an average of about 0.5 cents throughout the day. Prices will vary moderately between 0.0 and 1.3 cents, with no significant price spikes.
