The upcoming week brings varied price developments in the electricity market. **Monday** still offers reasonable prices, but in the afternoon and evening hours, prices may rise to over 15 cents per kilowatt-hour. On Tuesday, the price trend continues upwards, and the day is expected to be the second most expensive of the week. Price spikes are expected particularly in the evening when wind power production is on the decline.

**Wednesday** stands out clearly as the most expensive day of the week. On this day, both the average and maximum prices rise significantly. This is partly due to the low wind power production, which remains below 1000 megawatts during the day. This scarcity raises prices, especially during the afternoon and evening hours. On Thursday, the price level calms down slightly, but single-hour price spikes may still occur.

**Friday** brings a decrease in prices, and the weekend continues this trend. **Saturday** and **Sunday** are the cheapest days of the week, with prices remaining moderate throughout the day and wind power production being strong. This indicates that consumers can expect cheaper electricity bills over the weekend.
