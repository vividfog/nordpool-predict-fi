The weekâ€™s price trend will split in two. On weekdays, prices are forecast to be elevated, and especially on **Wednesday** the weekâ€™s highest average, 14,0 Â¢, will form. The intraday maximum, 23,1 Â¢, is expected in the afternoon peak around 16:00â€“18:00. This is explained by a very low minimum wind output (201 MW) on the same day. On **Thursday**, spike risk is also anticipated for the morning hours around 07:00â€“09:00, and **Fridayâ€™s** highest level would occur in the morning around 08:00â€“10:00, when the dayâ€™s maximum reaches 15,6 Â¢. Tuesday will stay mid-range.

For the weekend, the price level is forecast to be clearly low. **Saturday** is a public holiday, and prices drop to an average of 2,0 Â¢; individual hours still carry spike risk in the late morning around 10:00â€“12:00. The cheapest hours fall on Saturday late evening, and a zeroâ€‘cent moment is expected around 22:00â€“24:00. Sunday will continue at low levels with no spike mentions. Next **Monday** the average price is forecast to stay around 2,1 Â¢; wind output will be plentiful, supporting the low level.
