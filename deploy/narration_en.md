The upcoming week seems relatively stable in terms of electricity prices. **Wednesday** and **Saturday** show the lowest price expectations, with negative average prices partly due to strong wind power, which lowers prices. **Thursday** and **Sunday** see slightly higher price expectations, but they remain affordable. **Friday's** expected average price is slightly higher as well, yet still under four cents.

Next **Sunday** and **Monday**, prices are expected to be slightly higher than other days, yet remain reasonable. Although a minor risk of price spikes is forecasted for Sunday, it's important to note that the forecast may still change. Towards the end of the week, price fluctuations are possible but not expected to be significant.

Wind power production appears to be variable but generally remains at a sufficiently high level to keep prices moderate. Potential price spikes may occur on Sunday evening when wind power production might be lower. Overall, the week is expected to proceed without significant deviations or major price fluctuations.
