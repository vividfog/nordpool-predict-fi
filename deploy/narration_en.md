The electricity price forecast indicates significant variations for the coming days. Differences between individual days will be substantial: the week's lowest prices will occur on **Friday**, when the average price will remain near zero, and nighttime prices will even dip negative. This exceptionally low price level will result from very strong wind power production, which will remain consistently high throughout the day on Friday.

The situation will change noticeably on **Saturday**, when electricity markets will experience a clear increase in prices. Saturday's average price will rise to six cents, and price spikes are expected within the day. The highest price increase will likely occur during the evening hours between 19:00 and 21:00, when prices may exceed 15 cents. Saturday's exceptionally high maximum price can be explained by particularly weak wind production, which will drop to very low levels in the early morning and daytime hours.

On **Sunday**, electricity prices will also remain somewhat elevated, around an average of 4,6 cents. Significant price fluctuations are expected again on Sunday morning, approximately between 08:00 and 10:00, when prices may rise exceptionally high, even exceeding 11 cents. Sunday's price fluctuations will also result from low wind power production during the morning hours.

The beginning of next week will bring more stability, although individual price spikes will still be anticipated. On **Monday**, prices will fluctuate widely, from about one cent up to nearly 12 cents, with the highest prices occurring in the evening hours between 19:00 and 21:00. On **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, prices will remain at a more moderate level, with averages around four cents, and no significant price spikes are expected.

Next **Thursday**, prices will rise slightly again, averaging around 5,7 cents. Individual high-priced hours will likely occur in the evening between 19:00 and 21:00, when prices may exceed ten cents.

Price fluctuations will be most evident during the weekend, when wind power production will be highly variable. This will lead to significant differences in individual hourly price levels, whereas on weekdays the situation will gradually stabilize.
