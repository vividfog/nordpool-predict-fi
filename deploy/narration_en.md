The coming week brings fluctuating electricity prices, with average prices ranging between 2.3 cents and 5.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. **Saturday** stands out with its lowest average price, and electricity is expected to be available at the lowest price level during the night. **Wednesday** and **Thursday** show higher average prices, possibly due to reduced wind power production.

Individual price spikes may appear particularly on Sunday, with an average price of 3.1 cents, but the risk of price-raising spikes exists. Sunday's highest price might occur in the morning between 8‚Äì10 a.m. **Monday** and **Tuesday** also face the risk of price spikes during the afternoon and evening. This may be due to fluctuations in wind power production, with Monday's prices peaking at 9.3 cents.

The week ends on **Friday**, with expected prices slightly below the week's highest level. Wind power production is generally moderate this week, which might contribute to a rise in prices.
