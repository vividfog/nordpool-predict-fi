|:-------------|:----------------:|:----------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| **Monday** | 4,4 | 2,6 - 5,5 | 2263 - 4455 | 1,5 |
| **Tuesday** | 3,3 | 0,7 - 8,3 | 1125 - 6734 | 2,2 |
| **Wednesday** | 2,4 | 0,2 - 4,4 | 3751 - 7078 | 3,0 |
| **Thursday** | 5,0 | 3,7 - 7,0 | 2012 - 3191 | 3,0 |
| **Friday** | 8,1 | 2,5 - 15,5 | 967 - 2374 | 2,9 |
| **Saturday** | 6,1 | 1,4 - 12,2 | 1030 - 3089 | 1,8 |
| **Sunday** | 2,1 | 0,9 - 3,6 | 3190 - 4032 | 1,3 |

Early-week price levels will be low. **Monday** will average 4,4 cents and Tuesday 3,3, and **Wednesday** will be at 2,4. **Thursday** will rise slightly to 5,0. The week’s highest average is expected on **Friday**, 8,1 ¢, when the maximum hourly price of 15,5 ¢ will also occur. Weak wind on Friday (minimum 967 MW) clearly explains the higher peak. **Saturday** is a public holiday, which usually eases demand, but weak wind will keep the level at 6,1 cents. **Sunday** will return to a clearly cheaper 2,1 cents.

The week’s cheapest hours will cluster in the night and early morning on Tuesday and Wednesday, dipping below one cent, for example on Wednesday around 00:00–02:00. On Friday, the risk of isolated price spikes will stand out in the afternoon: the peak will fall around 15:00–17:00 at 15,5 ¢. On Saturday, the spike risk will target the morning around 08:00–10:00, when prices will reach 12,2 ¢. Late-week variation will be explained by wind output: on Friday and Saturday wind power averages will stay below 2 000 MW, whereas on Wednesday and Sunday supply will be clearly stronger, which will weigh on prices.
