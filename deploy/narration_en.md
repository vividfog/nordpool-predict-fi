The electricity price development for the coming days will be varied. Clearly higher prices will occur on **Saturday**, when the daily average price will reach 8.1 cents, with momentary price spikes approaching as high as 20 cents. Saturday's peak price is expected in the morning between 8‚Äì10 o'clock, when the forecast approaches 20 cents per kilowatt-hour.

On **Friday**, electricity prices will also exhibit significant fluctuation. The average daily price will be around 7.6 cents, but notably higher prices, exceeding 16 cents, are forecast for the evening between 19‚Äì21 o'clock. Both Friday and Saturday stand out as days with elevated risk of high price spikes.

The week's most affordable days will be **Sunday** and **Monday**, when average electricity prices will remain below two cents. On both days, prices will occasionally fall into negative territory. Sunday afternoon between 12‚Äì16 o'clock and early Monday morning between 3‚Äì5 o'clock will see prices dropping below zero, reaching as low as -0.9 cents early Monday.

The beginning of the week overall will be an inexpensive time for electricity consumption. Prices on **Tuesday** and **Wednesday** will remain moderate, averaging two to three cents. On Thursday, the price level will rise slightly but remain affordable at around 3.5 cents.

During the week, wind power production will vary considerably. On Friday and Saturday, wind power will dip to very low levels at times, partly explaining these days' high price spikes. From Sunday onward, wind power production will increase significantly, immediately reflected in clearly lower prices and negative price levels.
