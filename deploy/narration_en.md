The price level will remain very expensive at first. On **Friday**, the daily average price will settle at 18.6 cents, and the highest hourly price will rise to 24.4 cents. Exceptionally weak wind will be visible in the background, because the wind-power average will remain at 1163 megawatts and the daily minimum will drop to 609 megawatts. Frost will also intensify, because the day’s average temperature will drop to -15.2°C.

Over the weekend, the direction will turn. On **Saturday**, the average price will still be high, at 17.9 cents, and a high risk of individual price spikes will be flagged for the day. The forecast’s highest hour will fall around 08:00–10:00. On **Sunday**, the average price will drop to 10.7 cents and wind power will be plentiful on average, at 3321 megawatts, but a risk of price spikes will still be noted for the day. On **Monday**, **Tuesday**, and **Thursday**, the risk of price spikes will also remain high, and the peak hours will, on weekdays, often be weighted toward the morning and early evening hours.
