| **Thursday**  | 1,7 | -0,2 - 3,0 | 2560 - 5662 | 6,3 |
| **Friday**| 5,4 | 1,6 - 9,6 | 1096 - 2370 | 7,5 |
| **Saturday** | 1,3 | -0,1 - 3,5 | 1842 - 4674 | 6,6 |
| **Sunday**| 2,9 | 0,9 - 5,4 | 1860 - 4645 | 5,0 |
| **Monday**| 6,0 | 1,2 - 11,0 | 1819 - 2512 | 4,7 |
| **Tuesday**  | 9,3 | 2,4 - 21,4 | 519 - 2455 | 4,7 |
| **Wednesday**| 9,9 | 2,4 - 20,8 | 807 - 2667 | 5,1 |

The week’s price trend will look split. **Thursday** and **Saturday** will remain low: average prices will sink to the 1–2 cent range, and brief negative prices will appear overnight on Thursday and around midday on Saturday. **Sunday** will stay moderate, with an average just under three cents. In contrast, **Tuesday** and **Wednesday** will turn expensive, with averages around 9–10 ¢.

Wind power variability will explain the large day-to-day differences. On **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, the highest hours will coincide with very low minimum wind output, at 519 MW and 807 MW. These low minima align with high daily peaks (21,4 ¢ on Tuesday and 20,8 ¢ on Wednesday) and explain intraday jumps. Conversely, Thursday and Saturday’s stronger wind will support low averages and occasional dips below zero.

**Friday** will average about 5,4 cents. The day will carry a single-hour spike risk, with the highest levels expected around late afternoon to early evening, roughly 16:00–18:00. Otherwise, Friday will stay within an estimated 2–9 cent range.

The new week will start with a higher **Monday** average (6,0 ¢) and an early-evening spike risk; the peak will likely fall at 16:00–18:00 (or 17:00–19:00). On **Tuesday**, the spike risk will be pronounced, and the most expensive hours will tend to the evening, around 18:00–20:00. On **Wednesday**, the highest window is expected in the morning at 07:00–09:00, with a milder lift also possible in the afternoon at 16:00–18:00. Because Tuesday’s and Wednesday’s maximum prices exceed 15 ¢ and wind minima are clearly below 1000 MW, realized peak-hour prices could come in above the forecast.
