*Next week's electricity price forecasts suggest significant fluctuations as wind power production varies and the risk of price spikes is high on several days. Average prices range from affordable to notably high, particularly over the weekend.*

Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant will undergo maintenance starting on 20.9.2025 at 01:00, with the maintenance period expected to end on 10.10.2025 at 01:00. Similarly, Loviisa 1 plant is on maintenance starting 6.9.2025 at 10:00, with the maintenance period anticipated to conclude on 2.10.2025 at 12:00. These maintenance outages may impact the accuracy of the price forecast as training data during maintenance periods is limited.

During the upcoming week, electricity prices will show significant variations. **Saturday** stands out as a particularly high-priced day, with the average electricity price rising to 13.9 cents. Price spikes are also expected, especially in the morning around 9-11 AM, when prices may exceed 27 ¢. This is influenced by low wind power production, which drops below 500 MW during certain hours.

On **Friday** and **Sunday**, the price level is also elevated but lower than on Saturday. Price spikes are expected on Friday afternoon between 4-6 PM, while on Sunday, risks are expected in the evening between 6-8 PM. On these days, lower wind power production contributes to the price increase.

**Thursday** and **Monday** feature more moderate prices, with an average price of about 5.6 ¢. On these days, there is ample wind power available, helping to keep prices low. **Tuesday** and **Wednesday** see prices rise again to a higher level, with Tuesday evening peaks potentially reaching up to 24 ¢ between 6-8 PM.

Nuclear plant maintenance outages may impact the forecast's accuracy, but variations in wind power production are a clearer driver of prices this week. As weather conditions remain typical, price fluctuations are mainly due to the dynamics of production and demand.
