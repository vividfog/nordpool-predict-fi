**Tuesday's** price expectations are also high, with an average of 9.7 cents. A significant price spike is expected on Tuesday evening between 19:00 and 21:00, with prices potentially rising to 34.1 cents.

**Wednesday** and **Monday** offer more affordable prices, with averages at 5.4 and 6.0 cents. However, on Wednesday afternoon, prices may temporarily rise to 20.3 cents between 19:00 and 21:00.

In the early part of the week, particularly on **Thursday**, prices are more moderate, but there is a risk of price spikes in the afternoon between 16:00 and 18:00.
