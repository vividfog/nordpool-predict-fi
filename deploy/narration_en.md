Next **Sunday**, the electricity price is expected to be very low, with an average price forecasted at just 0.1 ¢/kWh. This is due to the abundant wind power production, which is expected to be strong throughout the day. **Monday** sees prices rise but remain at a reasonable level, with an average price of 3.3 ¢/kWh. Monday will have variable wind power, but there is no risk of price spikes.

Tuesday will see a significant price increase, with the daily average rising to 13.2 ¢ and a maximum price forecasted at 27.4 ¢. This is particularly due to the low minimum wind power production, which falls below 600 MW. On Tuesday, there is a high risk of price spikes, especially during the morning. **Wednesday** continues the risk of price spikes, although the daily average price decreases to 8.5 ¢. Wednesday's price fluctuations are large, driven by variable wind power production.

**Thursday** sees prices drop again, with an average price expected to be 2.4 ¢/kWh. Wind power production is at a moderate level, and the risk of price spikes remains low. **Friday** is slightly more expensive than Thursday, but the average price remains moderate at 4.9 ¢/kWh. Saturday brings more price variability, with the daily average rising to 8.0 ¢ and a maximum price that could reach 22.4 ¢. On Saturday, there is a high risk of price spikes, particularly in the evening.
