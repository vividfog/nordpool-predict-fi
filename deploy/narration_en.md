| **Friday** | 4,0 | 0,8 - 9,6 | 2478 - 5994 | 1,3 |
| **Saturday** | 2,9 | 1,3 - 4,4 | 3152 - 6110 | 1,2 |
| **Sunday** | 3,0 | 1,5 - 4,3 | 4306 - 6058 | -0,2 |

A higher price level is expected at the start of the week. **Tuesday** is projected to average 7,8 ¢, and a risk of isolated increases is noted; the morning peak would fall around 09:00–11:00 at about 10,6 ¢. Average wind output on Tuesday stays at 2389 MW, which is low and supports higher prices. **Wednesday** is a public holiday, yet the day’s high will still arrive in the morning around 08:00–10:00, about 13,9 ¢. This is explained by weak wind in the morning hours (minimum 1518 MW), which increases intraday variation.

Later in the week, the price level will turn low. The public holidays on **Thursday** and **Friday** will ease demand, and averages will remain at 4,6 and 4,0 ¢. On **Saturday** and **Sunday**, average prices will be 2,9–3,0 ¢, and on **Monday** 3,2 ¢. Strong winds from Thursday onward will support low prices. The week’s cheapest moments will fall on the weekend: on Saturday and Sunday around midday, 11:00–13:00, prices will dip to 1,3–1,5 ¢; and next **Monday** the low will occur overnight at 02:00–04:00, about 1,0 ¢. The clearly most expensive hours will cluster in the Tuesday–Wednesday mornings, whereas from Thursday onward prices will stay broadly below 8 ¢.
