*According to the forecast, electricity prices will remain stable in the coming days, but over the weekend, prices will drop significantly due to the abundant supply of wind power. However, higher prices are expected on Wednesday due to low wind power production.*

In the near future, electricity price trends appear to be relatively stable, but a few distinctive features are noticeable. **Saturday** stands out as the most affordable day of the week, with the expected average price even negative, around -0.0 ¢/kWh. This is explained by the high wind power production, averaging 5252 MW. Sunday follows with slightly higher but still low prices, with an average price of 0.6 ¢/kWh.

At the start of the week, **Monday** and **Tuesday** appear slightly more expensive, with average prices at 3.8 and 2.5 ¢/kWh. During these days, wind power production decreases significantly, which partly raises the price level. The minimum wind power production on Monday, 1359 MW, is the lowest of the week, partly explaining the higher price of the day.

**Wednesday** is expected to see a higher maximum price in the forecast, potentially reaching up to 10.7 ¢. This day stands out from the others, as wind power production is at its lowest at 1334 MW, which predictably raises electricity prices. The risk of price spikes is mentioned during individual hours, so this day should be noted more carefully.

Towards the end of the week, prices stabilize again, and **Thursday** looks considerably more affordable, with an average price of 2.0 ¢/kWh. Wind power production remains at a reasonable level, which partly supports the decline in prices.
