The upcoming week‚Äôs price forecasts show varying trends. **Wednesday** and **Thursday** maintain moderate prices, although Thursday sees a peak price exceeding 10 cents. This could be due to fluctuating wind power production, as **Thursday** features the lowest wind power levels at 1618 MW, impacting price levels.

**Friday** and the weekend appear more affordable, especially on **Saturday** and **Sunday**, when prices drop significantly. Prices remain below 5 cents on **Saturday** and **Sunday**, with moderate wind power availability supporting the lower price levels.

**Monday** continues to see low prices, but on **Tuesday**, the highest average price of the week is observed at 6.3 ¬¢/kWh. Tuesday‚Äôs high maximum price of 13.1 ¬¢ may be explained by low morning wind power production, which is only 1724 MW. This elevates the price levels, particularly in the first half of the day.

The week proceeds with varying price signals, but the most significant fluctuations seem to concentrate at the start of the week. **Wednesday** and, notably, **Tuesday** stand out as days with higher prices. The weekend, however, offers more affordable electricity prices, which may encourage users to schedule their consumption during this period.
