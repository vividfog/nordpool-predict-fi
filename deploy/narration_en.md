Next week will remain mostly inexpensive. Daily averages will mostly settle between 1–3 cents. An exception will be **Monday**, with an expected average of 4.4 ¢, and especially **Thursday**, with a projected daily average of 6.0 ¢. On several days, such as in the early hours of **Sunday** and **Wednesday**, prices will briefly dip below zero. Strong wind generation on many days (over 3000 MW on average) will support low prices.

The clearest outlier will be **Thursday**: the maximum is forecast at 16.8 ¢, and individual spikes are expected between 17:00–19:00. The high peak will be explained by a very low wind minimum (around 1024 MW) on the same day. Other days will stay moderate, and the lowest hours will typically occur at night and early morning. Toward the end of the week prices will return to the 1–3 ¢ range, and for example on **Tuesday** and **Saturday** the minima will dip slightly below zero.
