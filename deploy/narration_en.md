Electricity prices vary significantly during the week. **Monday** sees high electricity prices with an average of 12.8 ¢/kWh and the day's peak price reaching up to 37.6 ¢. This is notably different from the rest of the week. On Monday, wind power production is low, which may contribute to the higher prices.

**Tuesday** and **Wednesday** show more moderate price levels. Tuesday's average price is 11.1 ¢ and Wednesday's is 6.5 ¢. However, Tuesday carries a risk of price spikes during morning and evening hours, when prices may temporarily rise. Wednesday also has a risk of price spikes, especially in the afternoon.

Towards the end of the week, prices are significantly lower. **Thursday** and **Friday** maintain an average electricity price below 1 ¢/kWh, with wind power supply at a strong level, which partly explains the low prices. The risk of price spikes on these days is minimal, so consumers can expect more stable price development.

**Saturday** and **Sunday** continue with low prices, but Saturday bears the possibility of price spikes, particularly in the evening when the price might rise above 7 ¢. On Sunday, price spikes may occur similarly starting in the afternoon.
