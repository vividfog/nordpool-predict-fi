At the start of next week, **Monday** stands out with its high average price, rising to 6.3 cents per kilowatt-hour. Significant price spikes are also expected on this day, particularly during the morning hours. Wind power production will be variable on Monday, which could partly explain the price increase. **Tuesday** continues the trend of high prices, with the average price rising slightly higher to 7.2 cents. Price spikes are also forecasted on Tuesday, especially during the morning and evening hours.

In the middle of the week, prices stabilize. On **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, electricity average prices drop to 3.4 and 3.1 cents, making them the most affordable days of the week. Wind power production is at a normal level during this time, which helps stabilize prices.

**Friday** brings slightly higher prices, with an average price of 5.5 cents. This could partly be due to fluctuations in wind power production, as the minimum production is the lowest of the week on Friday. As the weekend approaches, **Saturday** and **Sunday** prices remain modest, with average prices below one cent, making them the cheapest days of the week.
