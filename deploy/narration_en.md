**On Wednesday** and **Thursday**, the price level will remain very low. Average prices will be in the 0,6–1,5 ¢ range, and brief negative prices will appear at night. Wind power will be abundant, supporting low prices. Daily peaks will stay at 1,8 ¢ on Wednesday and 2,9 ¢ on Thursday, keeping daytime rates moderate as well.

**On Friday**, the average price will rise to 3,3 ¢ but remain inexpensive. In the evening, around 18:00–20:00, prices will climb noticeably, up to 7,7 ¢. **On Saturday** and **Sunday**, averages will return to roughly the 1–2 ¢ range. Variability over the weekend will be modest, with lows and highs staying below 3 ¢, except for Sunday evening when the upper end reaches 2,9 ¢.

**On Monday**, the price level will shift. The daily average will rise to 8,7 ¢, and individual evening hours will be priced clearly higher. The daily peak hour is forecast at 17,0 ¢, most likely between 17:00 and 19:00. Low minimum wind output (1 675 MW) helps explain the higher maximum price. A high risk of individual price spikes is indicated for the day.

**On Tuesday**, upward pressure will continue. The daily average will rise to 12,0 ¢ and the daily high to 24,6 ¢, likely occurring between 17:00 and 19:00. Minimum wind output will be exceptionally low (943 MW), which is clearly linked to the higher maximum price. Because winds will be very weak and the peak exceeds 15 ¢, prices during individual peak hours could come in higher than forecast. The projections may still be refined if wind expectations change.
