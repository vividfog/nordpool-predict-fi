The upcoming week begins with stable price developments, but as the weekend approaches, forecasts show significantly higher electricity prices. On **Monday** and **Tuesday**, prices are expected to remain quite moderate, with average prices around 1.2 ¢ and 2.1 ¢. On Tuesday, prices are expected to range from negative to a maximum of about six cents, indicating affordable electricity.

On **Wednesday**, electricity prices may vary more, reaching up to 9.7 ¢. Wind power fluctuates significantly on Wednesday, partly explaining the price variation. On **Thursday**, price expectations stabilize slightly but remain below seven and a half cents.

On **Friday**, prices rise slightly, with an average of nearly six cents. During the weekend, price forecasts show clearly higher figures. On **Saturday** and **Sunday**, prices rise to an average of over ten cents, and particularly on Sunday, the maximum price may exceed 30 ¢. This is partly explained by very weak wind power, which increases the risk of price spikes.
