Electricity price expectations will show clear variation within the week. On **Saturday** and **Sunday**, average prices will stay below three cents, making the weekend clearly inexpensive. Price ranges will settle at 1,2â€“3,0 Â¢ on Saturday and 0,3â€“4,2 Â¢ on Sunday. Strong wind production will explain the low level especially on Sunday, when average wind is high.

The first weekday, i.e., **Monday**, will see the average price rise to 7,4 cents. The day will include a risk of individual spikes, and the highest hour will be in the evening according to the forecast; the peak would occur between 17:00 and 19:00. Wind power will remain low (min 1413 MW), which supports intra-day price variation.

The clearest outlier of the week will be **Tuesday**, when the average will rise to 11,3 cents and the maximum is forecast at 23,7 Â¢. The risk of a high spike will be clear, and the peak would most likely fall in the evening between 17:00 and 19:00. Elevated levels will also be seen in the mornings around 07:00â€“09:00. The day's minimum wind output will drop very low, to 609 MW, and this exceptionally low minimum will, together with other demand, explain Tuesdayâ€™s higher maximum price.

Also on **Wednesday**, the average price will remain high, at 11,5 cents. The risk of price spikes will be high, and the peak would fall in the afternoon between 16:00 and 18:00 (daily maximum 20,2 Â¢). Morning levels will rise close to the 20,0 Â¢ mark at 07:00â€“09:00. Behind this is weak wind, with a minimum down to 811 MW. On **Thursday**, the price level would settle closer to the five-cent average, but there will be a risk of a single morning peak around 07:00â€“09:00 (max 8,8 Â¢). On **Friday**, the average will rise again to 9,9 cents, and spikes are anticipated both in the morning at 08:00â€“10:00 (max 17,4 Â¢) and in the evening at 17:00â€“19:00 (levels above 16 Â¢). Weak wind (min 956 MW) will underpin Fridayâ€™s pronounced peaks.

Overall, the weekend will be inexpensive, Tueâ€“Wed will be on the pricey side, and Friday will sit between them. Spikes will concentrate in the morning and especially in the evening hours, as wind production minima drop low.
