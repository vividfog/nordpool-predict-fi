The electricity price trend for the week will be variable. **Sunday** is expected to have low prices, with an average of -0.4 ¢/kWh. Price fluctuations on this day will be minor, and no price spikes are anticipated. Higher wind power production on Sunday supports the reduced prices.

Prices are set to rise markedly on **Monday** and **Tuesday**, with average prices at 6.2 ¢ and 7.0 ¢ respectively. Both days carry a high risk of price spikes, particularly during morning and evening hours. On these days, low wind power production contributes to higher electricity prices. On Monday, the maximum price could rise to 14.7 ¢.

**Wednesday** sees a decline in prices again, with an average price of 3.2 ¢. This is partly due to increased wind power, which reduces price pressure. On this day, the risk of price spikes is minimal.

Towards the end of the week, **Thursday** and **Friday** maintain low electricity prices, averaging 1.4 ¢ and 2.0 ¢ respectively. Wind power production is strong on Thursday, explaining the low price levels.

**Saturday** again brings low price levels, with an average price of 0.4 ¢. Wind power production is robust, supporting the maintenance of low prices.
