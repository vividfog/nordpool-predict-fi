In the coming week's electricity market, moderate prices are expected, although small variations are anticipated. On **Wednesday**, prices range between 1.3 and 5.0 cents, with wind power production at a reasonable level, keeping prices in check. **Thursday** is expected to see slightly higher prices, with a maximum of 6.3 cents, partly due to wind power fluctuations, which drop to as low as 100 MW.

The lowest prices of the week seem to fall on **Sunday**, with the average price forecasted at just 1.3 cents. Wind power production is at a relatively good level then. On **Friday** and **Saturday**, prices remain significantly low, although **Friday** might experience price spikes during individual hours.

At the start of the next week, **Monday's** prices might rise higher, up to 8.5 cents, making it the most expensive day of the week. This is partly explained by the low wind power production during the morning hours. **Tuesday** sees prices leveling out again, but small spikes are still anticipated.
