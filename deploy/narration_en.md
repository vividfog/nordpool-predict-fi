Thursday is marked with a high risk of hourly price spikes, and the peak will fall in the forecast between 10:00 and 12:00. A very low wind-power minimum is also visible in the background, 273 MW, and it will occur on the same day as the highest maximum price.

The lowest daily average price will fall on **Sunday**, when the average will stay at 11.1 cents and hourly prices will remain within 7.2–14.5 cents. On Wednesday, the cheapest individual hour will fall at night, with the low at 6.9 cents. For Friday, Saturday, Monday, and Tuesday, the forecast notes a high spike risk, and the highest hourly prices will tilt toward daytime and early evening. In addition, the entire period will be shaped by severe frost, as the average temperature will stay below -5°C every day.
