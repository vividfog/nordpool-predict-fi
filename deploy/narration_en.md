*According to the forecast, the early week will split in two: Tue–Wed will push prices up due to weak wind with an elevated spike risk, whereas from Thursday onward levels will ease as wind strengthens. Friday will stay mid-range, the weekend mostly moderate with spike risk on Saturday. The lowest levels will appear on Thursday and Sunday.*

| **Tuesday** | 17,1 | 6,9 - 29,3 | 487 - 1934 | 6,4 |
| **Wednesday** | 10,9 | 3,7 - 23,7 | 564 - 3336 | 6,4 |
| **Thursday** | 2,4 | 1,2 - 3,5 | 3400 - 4888 | 7,5 |
| **Friday** | 5,5 | 0,7 - 9,9 | 2080 - 4505 | 5,9 |
| **Saturday** | 6,0 | 3,9 - 10,7 | 2004 - 2910 | 5,2 |
| **Sunday** | 2,2 | 1,1 - 4,1 | 2249 - 5360 | 4,7 |

The week will start at a fairly moderate price level. **On Monday** the average settles around four cents with a 0,1–7,7 ¢ range. The intraday profile will tilt toward the evening, without exceptional swings.

The clearest outlier will be **on Tuesday**. The day’s average rises to 17,1 ¢ and the maximum to 29,3 ¢. The risk of single-hour spikes will be high, especially in the morning at 9–11 and in the evening at 19–21. The backdrop is exceptionally weak wind: the wind minimum drops to 487 MW and the daily average stays below 1000 MW. With very low minimum output and a peak clearly above 15 ¢, realized peak-hour prices could exceed the forecast.

A higher level will continue **on Wednesday**, with a daily average of 10,9 ¢ and a maximum of 23,7 ¢. Spike risk will focus on the morning, particularly at 8–10. The pattern is the same as Tuesday: the wind minimum remains at 564 MW and intraday production swings are large, which explains the higher peak.

Prices will ease markedly on Thursday. **On Thursday** the average is 2,4 ¢ with a 1,2–3,5 ¢ range. Strong wind (on average over 4000 MW) will support low prices throughout the day, and the cheapest hours will cluster around 20–22. **On Sunday** the trend will be similar: a 2,2 ¢ average and strengthening wind that keeps levels low. The cheapest slot will appear in the evening around 20–22.

Mid-range levels will fill the rest of the week. **On Friday** the average is 5,5 ¢ and the daily high lands in the morning at 8–10 (up to 9,9 ¢). **On Saturday** the average stays near six cents, but single-hour spike risk will stand out in the evening at 19–21, when levels climb above ten cents.
