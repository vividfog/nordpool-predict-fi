In the coming week, electricity prices will vary significantly. **Sunday** stands out with a higher average price of 4.0 ¬¢/kWh, with the maximum price rising to over 12 cents. This may be due to low minimum wind power production, which falls below 2000 MW. Sunday‚Äôs price spikes are expected to occur between 18:00 and 20:00. On other days, prices will be significantly lower, with **Thursday** and **Saturday** offering average prices below one cent.

**Friday** and **Saturday** are expected to be relatively affordable, with average prices remaining close to 0.8 and 0.6 ¬¢/kWh. Wind power production is variable on these days but normal on a monthly basis. On Saturday, the average wind power production falls below 2500 MW, which may partly explain the day's low price level.

**Monday** will see a slight increase in average price to 1.5 ¬¢/kWh, and **Tuesday** continues the upward price trend with an average price of 2.1 ¬¢/kWh. **Wednesday** concludes the week with a slightly higher average price of 3.0 ¬¢/kWh.
