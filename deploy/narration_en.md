The week progresses with variable electricity prices and wind power production figures. On **Wednesday**, the electricity average price is expected to remain low, around zero cents, with abundant wind power available, which could explain the affordable price level. **Thursday**'s price expectations rise slightly but remain moderate, with no significant risk of price spikes.

**Friday** forecasts potential price spikes, especially during the morning hours, when the wind power minimum level is at its lowest. The maximum price level could then exceed five cents. During the weekend, on **Saturday** and **Sunday**, the electricity average price stays close to one and a half cents, but on Sunday, the risk of price spikes may increase during evening hours, with maximum prices potentially exceeding five cents.

Early **next week**, on **Monday** and **Tuesday**, a rising trend in price development is expected, with an average price of up to 2.7 cents on Monday. This could be due to the wind power production remaining at low levels, which may contribute to price increases. Price spikes might occur on Monday and Tuesday, particularly during the evening hours.
