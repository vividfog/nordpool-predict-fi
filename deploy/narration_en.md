*Electricity prices will fluctuate markedly over the week: Tuesday will be clearly the most expensive and Wednesday elevated as well as wind output stays low; Thursday and Sunday will be broadly inexpensive thanks to stronger winds. The risk of price spikes will concentrate on Tuesday morning and evening and partly on Wednesday.*

Forecast updated on Sunday at 21:26.

Clear day-to-day differences will be expected during the week. **On Tuesday** the average price will rise clearly above the other days, and **on Wednesday** prices will remain on the higher side. By contrast, **on Thursday** and **on Sunday** prices will turn broadly low. **On Monday** the week will start at a moderate level, and **on Friday** and **on Saturday** prices will sit around mid-range.

**On Tuesday** the average will be 16,9 ¢, which falls into the very expensive range. Daily highs will cluster in the morning and evening: 29,0 ¢ around 9–11, and 26–28 ¢ around 19–21. The risk of price spikes will be high during these hours. Average wind output will remain at 895 MW and the minimum at only 462 MW. The low minimum wind output will help explain the day’s higher maximum price.

**On Wednesday** an average of 10,5 ¢ will be expected. The risk for isolated hours will stand out in the morning around 8–10, when the price will reach about 23,0 ¢. Wind output will dip to a 529 MW minimum and average 1585 MW, which is low and will partly explain the higher peak.

**On Thursday** the range will lie between 1,1–3,4 ¢ with an average of 2,1 ¢. Strong winds of 3492–4711 MW will support the low price level throughout the day. **On Sunday** another broadly inexpensive day will be expected, 1,2–4,5 ¢ with an average of 2,5 ¢, supported by abundant wind at 2086–5344 MW.

**On Monday** the average price will be 7,6 ¢. Nighttime hours will hover close to zero, and the priciest period will land in the evening around 18–20, near 19,9 ¢. **On Friday** (avg 5,7 ¢) the morning and late morning will be relatively pricier for the week, but peaks will stay near 10,6 ¢. **On Saturday** (avg 6,2 ¢) prices will climb toward the evening, topping out around 11,8 ¢, without a distinct spike risk.
