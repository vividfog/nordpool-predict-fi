In the coming days, the electricity market expects variable price trends. The average price for **Thursday** is predicted to be 5.1 cents per kilowatt-hour, making it the most expensive day of the week. Wind power production falls below 2000 megawatts at its minimum on Thursday, partly explaining the higher maximum price of up to 9.8 cents. **On Friday**, prices drop significantly, with an average price expected to be 2.6 cents. This is partly due to strong wind power, which smooths out the price level.

**Saturday** and **Sunday** maintain exceptionally low prices, with average prices of just 0.2 and 0.1 cents. This is particularly due to strong wind power increasing production levels. Over the weekend, prices remain close to zero throughout the day, and individual hours may even be negative.

Next **Monday**, the price rises slightly but remains low at an average of 0.9 cents. The beginning of the week continues to show strong wind power, which stabilizes the price. **On Tuesday**, the price climbs closer to two cents but remains affordable. The highest maximum price of the week, 7.7 cents, is forecasted for Tuesday, possibly due to wind power fluctuations during the day.

The week ends with **Wednesday**, where the price settles at 2.0 cents. At this time, wind power production remains strong, keeping prices in check. Overall, the coming week offers affordable electricity prices, thanks to strong wind power and moderate weather.
