The highest average price of the week is expected on **Monday**, when the average is set to reach 17.1 cents and the day’s top hourly price is forecast at 25.6 cents. The day is explained by a very low wind-power minimum of 597 MW, while sub-zero temperatures will remain severe. On an hourly level, the highest period will be concentrated in the late morning from 08:00 to 10:00, when the price will rise above 24 cents. A high risk of price spikes is flagged for the day in individual hours.

**Tuesday** is a public holiday, and demand is expected to remain below normal. That is reflected in a lower average price of 12.6 cents. On **Wednesday**, the average will drop to 11.4 cents, yet a risk of price spikes is still flagged. On Saturday, volatility will increase, as wind power is forecast to bottom out at 946 MW and the maximum price will climb to 19.6 cents. Sunday is expected to bring a 13.3-cent average price, and it is also flagged for a high risk of individual price spikes.
