**Friday's** price expectations are moderate, with an average price of 2.0 cents per kilowatt-hour. The day starts off cheap, but prices rise towards the evening, peaking at 5.8 ¢. The weekend brings low electricity prices, as **Saturday** and **Sunday** feature exceptionally low average prices. Saturday's average price is -0.3 ¢/kWh, and Sunday's is 0.2 ¢/kWh, offering consumers a chance to save on their electricity bills. On these days, strong wind power production partly explains the low prices.

**Monday** starts the new week with a reasonable average price of 3.2 ¢/kWh. Wind power production is lower, but price spikes are not expected. **Tuesday** continues with similar price fluctuations, although the average price remains similar to Monday. The highest price of the day reaches 7.7 cents, but this is offset by a low minimum price.

**Wednesday** sees an increase in electricity prices, with an average price of 5.2 ¢/kWh. In particular, there is a risk of price spikes in the evening, with the maximum price reaching 10.5 cents. This could be due to the low wind power production, which is expected to be at a minimum of 1352 MW.

**Thursday** brings the situation back to a more reasonable level, with the average price dropping to 1.8 ¢/kWh. Wind power production is at a normal level, and no price spikes are expected, keeping electricity prices reasonable throughout the day.
