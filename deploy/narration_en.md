The electricity market for the upcoming week will be quite variable. Average prices will generally remain affordable, but clear price increases will occur during certain hours early in the week.

The week's lowest daily average price, just one cent per kilowatt-hour, will occur on **Saturday**. The lowest hourly prices of the week will also appear on Saturday, when prices become negative in the early morning between 3:00 and 8:00. Negative prices, albeit briefly, will also occur on **Sunday** around 2:00 in the early morning.

The highest hourly prices of the week will occur on **Tuesday**, when the price could reach 11,2 cents around 9:00 in the morning. On the same day, wind power production will drop significantly, down to just 187 megawatts. This exceptionally low wind generation explains the somewhat higher peak-hour prices on Tuesday. Thus, the risk of price spikes on Tuesday is real during certain morning hours.

On **Monday**, price spikes will also be possible, especially in the early evening between 18:00‚Äì20:00, when prices approach ten cents. However, the daily average price will remain moderate, around 4,7 cents. Wednesday and Thursday will be relatively calm in terms of prices, although Thursday's price fluctuations could briefly raise the rate to seven cents around 9:00 in the morning.

On Friday, price levels will drop again, with the daily average settling at 2,6 cents. Moving into the weekend, prices will continue to decrease, with Saturday being the cheapest day of the entire week.

Overall, prices will fluctuate significantly throughout the week. Early in the week will be somewhat more expensive, but price expectations become clearly more affordable by the weekend.
