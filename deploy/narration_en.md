The highest average price of the week will be expected on **Monday**, when the average will come in at 18.3 cents and the day’s highest hourly price will reach 28.7 cents in the forecast. Cold weather will also be visible in the background, along with an unusually low minimum in wind power output, which will drop to 700 MW. The price peak will be concentrated in the evening, and the highest stretch will fall around 17:00–19:00.

**Tuesday** will be a public holiday, and it may reduce demand. The day’s average price will come in at 14.5 cents. However, the risk of price spikes will be high for individual hours. The same risk will be flagged for **Wednesday** and **Thursday**. On **Friday**, prices will fall to the clearly cheapest average level of the week, at 7.6 cents. On **Saturday**, volatility will increase sharply, as the forecast minimum will be 4.8 cents and the maximum 23.6 cents, and the risk of price spikes will be high. On **Sunday**, the average price will rise again to 14.6 cents, and the spike risk will remain.
