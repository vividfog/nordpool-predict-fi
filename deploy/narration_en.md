The upcoming week presents a diverse price environment, with **Monday** having the highest average price of the week at 3.5 ¢/kWh, partly due to low wind power, which may increase prices. **Saturday** and **Sunday** are expected to have similar averages of 2.8 ¢/kWh, but there is a possibility of price spikes on Sunday during individual hours, particularly in the morning at 8 AM and in the evening at 6 PM.

**Tuesday** and **Wednesday** are forecasted to be low-cost days with average prices of 1.3 ¢/kWh and 0.9 ¢/kWh. On Wednesday, wind power is expected to be particularly strong, explaining the low price. **Thursday** and **Friday** maintain reasonable price expectations, but individual hourly spikes may occur, especially on Thursday evening.

Towards the weekend, especially **Friday's** forecasts indicate price variation, but the average price remains reasonable. Overall, the coming week does not contain dramatic price fluctuations, but individual hour and day-specific spikes are possible.
