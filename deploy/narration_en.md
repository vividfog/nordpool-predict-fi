In the coming week, electricity market prices will vary somewhat but remain mostly affordable. **Saturday** and **Sunday** stand out with their low average prices, around 1.8-1.9 cents per kilowatt-hour. However, price spikes are forecasted for these days, particularly in the evening when maximum prices may rise above seven cents.

**Monday** sees prices remain modest, with an average price of 2.1 cents. Wind power is moderate, helping to keep prices low. **Tuesday** sees a slight increase in expected prices but remains below three cents. No significant price spikes are forecasted for this day.

Midweek, on **Wednesday**, the average price rises to 3.5 cents. Wind power production is variable, which may partly explain the higher maximum prices. **Thursday** and **Friday** continue this trend, with Thursday's average price at four cents and Friday's just under four cents. There is a risk of price spikes on both days, especially in the evenings when wind power production is at its lowest.

Overall, while next week's electricity prices are mostly affordable, individual price spikes may temporarily increase costs. Weather conditions and variations in wind power production can affect price developments. *Price forecast by gpt-4o.* üå¨Ô∏è
