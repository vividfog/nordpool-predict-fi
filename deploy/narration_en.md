Price expectations for the week will be mostly low. The most notable day will be **Wednesday**, with an average of 6,3 ¢ and a projected maximum of 12,7 ¢. The lowest hourly wind output (min 1,444 MW) coincides with the same day, which explains the higher peak. Wednesday will be a public holiday, but weak wind can still lift prices. The peak would fall around the morning rush, roughly 7–9 a.m.

Prices on **Thursday** and **Friday** will be clearly lower (avg 3,2 ¢), and strong wind at 4–7 GW will keep levels down. Both will be public holidays, which lightens demand. The week’s lowest average will be on **Saturday**, about 2,0 ¢; the cheapest hours fall in the early morning, around 2–4 a.m. On **Sunday** and next **Monday**, prices will return to roughly 3,4–4,1 ¢. On **Tuesday**, the price will be slightly higher (avg 4,2 ¢), consistent with a lower average wind level.
