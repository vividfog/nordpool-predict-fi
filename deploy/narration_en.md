According to the forecast, **Thursday** prices will settle in the mid-range (avg 12,1 ¢, range 2,8–17,8). **Friday** stands out as the week’s most expensive: avg 14,1 ¢ with a peak at 23,0 ¢. The risk of price spikes for individual hours will be elevated, leaning toward early evening around 17:00–19:00. Wind power’s minimum output on Friday will drop to just 642 MW, which explains the high maximum price. **Saturday** is a public holiday that may ease demand and push prices down; the average will stay at 5,6 ¢. Even so, isolated spikes may appear, most likely around midday, 11:00–13:00.

**Sunday** will remain moderate (avg 6,5 ¢). **Monday** will move closer to normal weekday levels, avg 9,8 ¢, and no spike risks are anticipated. **Tuesday** will tighten again: avg 11,4 ¢ with a daily high of 18,1 ¢, and spike risk will hit the morning around 08:00–10:00; behind this is low wind power (min 913 MW, avg 1939 MW). **Wednesday** will calm back to 6,8 ¢ with abundant wind power. The most affordable stretches of the week will arrive over the weekend, especially Saturday, while the priciest moments will land in early Friday evening.
