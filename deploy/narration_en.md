This week's electricity price forecast indicates clear variation between weekdays. Prices will be lowest during the weekend and highest in the middle of the week.

**Wednesday** clearly stands out as the most expensive day of the week. The average price will be 7,1 cents per kilowatt-hour, and hourly price spikes of up to 16,6 cents could be seen. The risk of price peaks occurs during morning hours between 8–10, when wind power production will be very low, around 287 megawatts.

**Thursday** will also see elevated electricity prices. The average price is forecasted at 5,8 cents, with a high risk of price peaks in the morning between 8–10, potentially reaching 14 cents. At the same time, wind power production will fall very low, around 172 megawatts. The high maximum prices on these two days can largely be explained by the scarcity of wind power.

The cheapest electricity prices of the week will occur during the weekend. **Saturday's** average price is only 1,0 cents, while **Sunday's** average is 1,3 cents. On Saturday, the electricity price will even turn negative (-0,4 cents) around noon, between 12–13. Negative prices will also occur on Sunday during the night hours between 2–3. These prices result from abundant wind power production expected during the weekend, keeping prices low.

At the week's start, on **Tuesday**, electricity prices will vary moderately, with an average price of 3,7 cents. The highest price, 10,2 cents, will occur Tuesday evening between 19–21.

Towards the end of the week, on **Friday** and next **Monday**, prices will remain moderate. Friday's average price will be 4,0 cents, and Monday's 4,9 cents. On both days, the highest hourly prices will hover around the 10-cent mark.
