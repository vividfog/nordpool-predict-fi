**Friday** appears more moderate, although the average price is 9.1 ¢/kWh. Price spikes are also expected on Friday due to low wind power production. **Saturday** and **Sunday** are the most affordable days of the week, with average prices at 6.1 ¢ and 5.6 ¢/kWh, respectively. There is also a risk of individual price spikes on Saturday and Sunday, but overall prices remain moderate.

Next **Monday** and **Tuesday** are expected to return to higher prices, especially on Tuesday, when the maximum price could rise to 23.4 ¢/kWh. With wind power production at its lowest at 964 megawatts, the risk of price spikes increases, particularly during the afternoon and evening hours.
