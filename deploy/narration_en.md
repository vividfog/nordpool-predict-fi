In the coming week, electricity prices are expected to vary across different days. On **Wednesday**, prices will fluctuate widely between 0.3 and 13.6 cents, with the average price forecasted at 5.5 cents. This is partly due to variations in wind power production, which can range from 1346 MW to 2677 MW.

**Thursday** and **Friday** are expected to have higher average prices, at 7.4 and 7.5 cents respectively. Both days carry a high risk of price spikes, particularly during morning and evening hours. On Thursday, wind power production can drop to a minimum of 385 MW, which may contribute to higher prices.

Over the weekend, prices will significantly decrease. On **Sunday**, the average electricity price is forecasted to be just 1.8 cents, making it the most affordable day of the week. High levels of wind power production on Sunday might help keep prices low.

On **Monday** and **Tuesday**, prices will rise slightly from Sunday's levels but remain moderate. Monday's average price is expected to be 3.7 cents, while Tuesday's is 3.8 cents. On Monday, wind power production can reach up to 3242 MW, which might help keep prices low.
