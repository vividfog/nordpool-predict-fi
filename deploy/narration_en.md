During the upcoming week, electricity market prices will vary notably from day to day. Overall, prices are expected to stay relatively low, but clear differences between the days will be observed. The cheapest day will be **Friday**, when the average price is expected to be only 0.1 cents per kilowatt-hour. On Friday, the lowest hourly prices of the week will occur, even dropping to negative values (-1.2 cents) early in the morning between 04:00 and 06:00. During this period, wind power production will be abundant, reaching over 6200 megawatts at its peak.

Prices will slightly increase the following day, as **Saturday** sees an average price of 1.7 cents. On Saturday evening between 19:00–21:00, some of the week's highest hourly prices will appear, peaking at 6.2 cents. Wind power production will remain at lower levels, partly explaining the price increase.

On **Sunday**, average prices will remain moderate at about 1.5 cents, although significant fluctuations will occur within the day. On Sunday afternoon between 13:00–15:00, electricity prices will even drop into negative territory, at their lowest reaching -1.0 cents. However, prices will again rise above six cents in the evening between 19:00–21:00, indicating a possibility of price spikes.

The most expensive days of the week will be **Monday** and next **Wednesday**, when average prices will clearly exceed other days. Monday's average price will be 3.0 cents, and Wednesday's will rise to 4.2 cents. On Monday evening between 19:00–21:00, prices will peak at 8.5 cents per kilowatt-hour, being the highest hourly rate of the entire week. On Wednesday, the highest price of 7.1 cents will also appear in the evening between 19:00–21:00. On both days, wind power production will be at lower-than-normal levels, contributing to these higher prices.

On **Tuesday**, prices will stay moderate throughout the entire day without significant fluctuations. The average price will be around 2.3 cents per kilowatt-hour, and no risk of price spikes is mentioned.

Thus, electricity market prices for the coming week will be predominantly affordable, although brief periods of price increases will occur, particularly on Monday and Wednesday evenings.
