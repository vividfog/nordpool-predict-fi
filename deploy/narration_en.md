The weekend will bring the lowest prices. The average for **Friday** is projected at 0.7 ¢ and for **Saturday** at 1.8 ¢. Brief negative prices are likely during the night hours on both days. On **Sunday**, the average rises to 3.1 ¢ but stays below four cents.

Next **Monday** the price level will tighten: the average is estimated at 9.9 ¢, with spike hours expected between 17:00–19:00. The day’s maximum is forecast at 17.1 ¢, and a very low wind power minimum (742 MW) partly explains the higher peak. Next **Tuesday** the average is expected at 8.3 ¢, with spike risk leaning toward the morning hours 09:00–11:00 (daily max 12.7 ¢). Midweek, **Wednesday** and **Thursday** are public holidays, when demand may be lower than normal; averages settle near 7.0 ¢ and 6.9 ¢.
