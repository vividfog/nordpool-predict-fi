*The electricity price forecast for next week suggests fluctuating prices, with wind power production and price spikes taking center stage. Higher prices on Monday and Friday stand out, while Tuesday and Sunday offer more affordable price expectations.*

Loviisa 2 nuclear power plant is undergoing maintenance, which began on August 17, 2025, at 04:00 and is expected to last until September 6, 2025, at 00:00. This maintenance may affect the accuracy of the electricity price forecast, as there is limited training data available from periods of maintenance outages.

The coming week will see significant variations in electricity prices. **On Monday**, prices are expected to average 2.4 cents per kilowatt-hour, with individual hours potentially rising to 7 cents due to low wind power production. This may be particularly noticeable during morning and evening hours. **On Tuesday**, prices are forecasted to drop significantly, with an average price of just 0.7 cents, driven by strong wind power production, which could reach up to 4466 MW. On Wednesday, prices are expected to rise slightly to an average of 2.1 cents, with a risk of price spikes.

**Thursday** brings higher price expectations, with an average price of 2.9 cents, and the risk of price spikes remains. **Friday** is expected to be the most expensive day of the week, with an average price of 3.3 cents and a maximum price reaching up to 8.4 cents. This is due to low wind power production in the morning. **Saturday** sees a return to an average price of 2.1 cents, with a lesser impact from wind power. **On Sunday**, electricity prices are expected to drop again, averaging 0.3 cents, partly due to increased wind power production.

In the week's price development, Monday and Friday stand out, as price spikes may be surprising. Weekend days offer a slightly calmer price development, but Sundayâ€™s low price level may attract consumers. *The price forecast was prepared by gpt-4o, closely monitoring the developments in the electricity market.* ðŸ”‹
