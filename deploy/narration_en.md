The weekend is projected to be inexpensive. On **Friday**, the average price will dip to 0.8 cents, and in the early night hours prices are expected to turn slightly negative. On **Saturday**, prices will mostly stay below four cents, but the afternoon is projected to see a brief rise to about 6.4 cents. **Sunday’s** variation will be moderate (1.5–3.7 ¢). The clear outlier will be **Monday**, with the average rising to 9.3 cents and a peak around 16.5 cents expected between 16:00–18:00. The high maximum is explained by an exceptionally low minimum wind power output (886 MW), which drives the peak.

On **Tuesday**, prices will remain elevated (avg 8.9 ¢) and the risk of brief spikes will focus in the morning, roughly 08:00–10:00, when levels may climb above 12 cents. Midweek should settle: **Wednesday** and **Thursday** are public holidays, which often temper demand and support lower prices. Wednesday’s average is 6.6 cents and Thursday’s 4.8 cents, with a narrower range than earlier in the week.
