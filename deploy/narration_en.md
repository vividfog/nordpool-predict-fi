| **Tuesday** | 4,9 | 1,9 - 9,6 | 1109 - 6717 | 2,2 |
| **Wednesday** | 5,6 | 1,4 - 11,4 | 1890 - 7074 | 3,0 |

The clearest outlier of the week will be **Friday’s** high price level: the average price is expected to reach 9,6 ¢ and the daily peak 17,5 ¢. The spike is forecast between 17:00–19:00. The explanation lies in weak wind: minimum wind output drops below 2,000 MW, coinciding with the week’s highest maximum price. The cheapest day will be **Sunday**, with the average at 3,4 ¢ and the top at 5,1 ¢; prices will stay very low especially overnight and in the morning.

There will also be spike risk on **Thursday** and **Saturday**. Thursday’s peaks will cluster around 08:00–10:00. On **Saturday** the risk will be highlighted in the late morning, 08:00–10:00; it is a public holiday, which may ease demand and temper prices at times. Early in the week prices will remain more moderate: Tuesday’s average will be 4,9 ¢ and on **Wednesday** strong wind will support a lower level. On **Monday** the average will settle at 6,6 ¢ without notable deviations.
