The upcoming week brings varied electricity price expectations. **Monday** sees relatively moderate price development, though there is a risk of price spikes. The average price is predicted to be 3.4 cents per kilowatt-hour, with significant hourly price variations possible. This is partly due to fluctuations in wind power production.

**Tuesday** is expected to have higher price levels, with an average price of 6.7 ¬¢/kWh. Price spikes are also predicted, particularly during the afternoon and evening hours. On **Wednesday**, electricity prices rise to a high level, with an average price of 10.4 ¬¢/kWh. This is due to low wind power production, which can further increase prices.

**Thursday** sees a slight decrease from Tuesday and Wednesday levels, but the risk of price spikes remains. The average price is predicted to be 6.1 cents. **Friday** offers more affordable prices, with an average price of just 1.6 ¬¢/kWh. Wind power production is expected to be high, contributing to the price decrease.

During the weekend, **Saturday** and **Sunday** provide consumers with more affordable prices. Saturday's average price is even negative, at -0.1 ¬¢/kWh, which is rare. On Sunday, prices remain moderate, with an average price of 0.7 ¬¢/kWh. On both days, wind power production is high, helping to keep prices low.
