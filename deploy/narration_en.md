On **Tuesday**, the highest prices will be during the morning hours between 8‚Äì10, reaching as high as 11,1 cents. On **Wednesday**, the corresponding peak will be between 8‚Äì10 in the morning, where the price forecast indicates a maximum of up to 11,8 cents/kWh.

**Monday's** prices will range between 2,4 and 8,6 cents, with an average of 4,9 cents. Prices will climb highest in the evening between 19‚Äì21, though these peaks will still remain significantly below the highs seen on Tuesday and Wednesday.

The lowest weekend prices will partly result from higher wind power production and lower weekend demand. Weather conditions in the coming week will not significantly affect electricity prices.
