The start of the week is expected to be inexpensive. **Tuesday’s** and **Wednesday’s** average price will be 0,9 ¢, and nights will dip below zero at times. Prices will be pressured by consistently abundant wind generation. **Saturday’s** average will also stay below three cents, while intraday variation will remain moderate.

The clearest exception will be **Thursday** afternoon, with a projected maximum of 15,3 ¢. The peak will most likely fall between 16:00–18:00. The intraday surge will be linked to weak minimum wind output (1673 MW), which falls below 2000 MW. **Sunday** is a public holiday, which may reduce demand, but wind will drop to just 414 MW at the weakest and the maximum is estimated at 12,4 ¢; the elevated risk will fall between 09:00–11:00. Next **Monday’s** average price will be the week’s highest, 6,2 ¢, and a single peak will occur around 07:00–09:00 (max 10,5 ¢). The cheapest hours of the week will land in the early-week nights, while Thursday’s and Sunday’s morning–evening hours are expected to be clearly pricier.
