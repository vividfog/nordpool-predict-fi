The week’s price level will fluctuate: the lowest days will fall on **Saturday** and **Thursday** (avg 3,7–3,8 ¢). Saturday will be a public holiday, which often lowers demand and shows up as a low average. Sunday will stay close to the inexpensive range (avg 4,3 ¢). The highest weekly average will be on Tuesday, 11,7 ¢, while Monday, Wednesday and Friday will sit between these.

The risk of price spikes will stand out on **Tuesday** in the late morning around 09:00–11:00, when the peak rises in the forecast to 21,0 ¢. The same day’s minimum wind output (488 MW) will be very low, which explains the high maximum price. **Friday** will also see elevated spike risk in the afternoon around 16:00–18:00, with the peak reaching 17,7 ¢; the day’s low wind minimum (783 MW) supports this. At other times, prices will remain clearly between these upper and lower bounds.
