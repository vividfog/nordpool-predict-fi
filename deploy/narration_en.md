In the upcoming week, electricity price expectations vary moderately, and no significant differences are anticipated between the days. **Tuesday** stands out in the forecast with its particularly low average price, hovering around zero. This is due to strong wind power production, exceeding 2800 MW for most of the day. Prices are also expected to remain low on **Saturday** and **Sunday**, below two cents, although wind power production is forecasted to be somewhat lower on Sunday.

**Friday** and **Thursday** may encounter higher prices, with daily averages around two and a half cents. This is partly due to lower wind power production, especially on **Thursday**, when production varies greatly throughout the day. There is a risk of price spikes on **Friday**, **Saturday**, **Sunday**, and **Thursday**, when individual hours could push up prices. Price increases are likely to concentrate in the morning and evening hours, particularly on **Friday** and **Thursday**.

During the weekend, on **Saturday** and **Sunday**, price spikes might occur, but their impact on the overall daily price level is expected to be limited. Overall, the predicted price trends are moderate, and no significant deviations from the average price are anticipated. Temperatures are expected to remain above 17 ¬∞C during the week, which does not significantly affect electricity prices.
