Prices will trend upward over the week. **Thursday**, **Friday**, and **Saturday** averages will stay at 1,3–1,7 cents. At night, prices will dip slightly below zero, especially during Thursday and Friday night hours. Early-week affordability will be supported by abundant wind generation (on average above 3000 MW), which will push prices down. On **Sunday**, the average will rise to 3,9 cents and intraday variation will increase, but it will still stay below ten cents.

The rise will continue on **Monday** (5,4 ¢) and **Tuesday** (7,3 ¢), with the day’s most expensive hours likely in the evening, roughly around 18:00–20:00. Next **Wednesday** will be the week’s clear outlier: the average will climb to 10,5 cents and the maximum is forecast at 16,9 ¢. There will be a risk of single-hour price spikes around 17:00–19:00. Behind this is weak wind: average output will stay around 1600 MW and the minimum is projected at only 1117 MW. The low minimum wind generation explains the higher maximum price.
