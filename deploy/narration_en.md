The electricity price forecast for the coming days will show notable variations. The week will start moderately priced, with an average electricity price of 3.7 cents per kilowatt-hour on **Tuesday**. The cheapest hours of the day will occur in the early morning between 4â€“6 am, when prices will dip below one cent. In the evening between 8â€“9 pm, however, the price will rise above 10 cents.

The most expensive day of the week will be **Wednesday**, with an average price rising to 7.3 cents. The peak price will be around 9 am (between 8â€“10 am), when the price could exceed 17 cents. The likelihood of price spikes during individual hours will be high on Wednesday, primarily due to very low minimum wind power production, just above 200 MW.

On **Thursday**, the price level will remain elevated, averaging 7.0 cents. Thursday's most expensive hours will be in the morning from 8â€“10 o'clock, with forecasted prices between approximately 13â€“15 cents. The risk of price spikes on individual hours remains high on Thursday as well, due to low wind power production.

Prices will decrease somewhat on **Friday**, with the daily average at 4.6 cents. In the evening from 7â€“9 pm, electricity will be notably cheaper, under three cents. Saturday and Sunday will offer the week's cheapest prices: **Saturday's** average price will be only 1.1 cents, and **Sunday's** 1.3 cents. On Sunday afternoon, negative prices will occur, meaning consumers may even receive a small compensation for using electricity.

Next week, on **Monday**, prices will rise slightly from the weekend, averaging 3.5 cents. However, the day's highest price will remain moderate, below six cents.
