| **Thursday** | 8,0 | 3,0 - 14,1 | 1079 - 3638 | 1,1 |

Weekly prices will mostly fall in the 5–9 cent range, but differences will appear. **Friday** will stand out as the week’s most expensive day: the average price will be 10,5 ¢ and the daily peak will rise to 19,6 ¢ around 17:00–19:00. The high maximum will be partly explained by wind output dipping clearly below 2000 MW at its minimum the same day. **Sunday** will be the cheapest: the average will be 3,1 ¢ and midday hours will be around 1–2 cents. On Monday and Tuesday, averages will remain moderate, and from Wednesday to Thursday levels will stay steady, even as evening peaks edge higher.

For spikes, attention will be focused on the days where risk is flagged. **On Saturday**, individual hours could climb in the morning around 07:00–09:00, even though the daily maximum is projected at 12,6 ¢. **On Wednesday**, a possible spike will fall in the evening near 17:00–19:00, and **on Thursday** the focus will come later, around 18:00–20:00. Thursday’s average price could be supported by generally weak wind, which will show up as a slightly elevated level across the day.
