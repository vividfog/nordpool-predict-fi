| **Thursday** | 6,2 | 2,9 - 8,9 | 2103 - 3752 | 3,0 |

| **Tuesday** | 11,9 | 3,3 - 20,2 | 652 - 2520 | 1,0 |

Clear variation will be expected over the week. The lowest-priced days will be seen on **Wednesday** and **Sunday**, when prices will mostly stay below five cents. Abundant wind will push prices down especially on Wednesday. The most distinct day will be **Tuesday**, with an average price of 11,9 ¢ and a projected maximum of 20,2 ¢. Tuesday’s exceptionally low minimum wind output, 652 MW, will explain the elevated peak. The peak will most likely fall between 10:00–12:00. **Thursday** and **Monday** will sit closer to the middle of the range, while **Friday** will already climb higher (avg 8,8 ¢) due to weaker winds.

The risk of price spikes will be emphasized especially on **Friday**, when a peak will be expected between 16:00–18:00 (up to 15,2 ¢). **Saturday** will be a public holiday, and demand may be lower than usual; still, a single peak will be possible between 09:00–11:00 (10,4 ¢). On **Monday**, the peak may hit the morning between 08:00–10:00 (11,0 ¢). On **Tuesday**, the spike risk will be the week’s highest, with late-morning hours forming the most likely peak window. The cheapest electricity will likely appear during Wednesday’s night and morning hours, when the price will drop in places well below four cents.
