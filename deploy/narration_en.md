On **Wednesday**, the average price will climb to 11.1 cents, and the day’s highest hourly price will reach 20.1 ¢. The day will also carry a high risk of price spikes in individual hours, and in the hourly forecast the peak will land around 18:00–20:00. On **Monday** as well, the average price will rise to 10.6 cents and the maximum price to 15.5 ¢, and a high spike-risk is flagged; the highest hours will fall around 17:00–19:00.

**Thursday** is a public holiday, which may lower demand and push the price down. Toward the end of the week, average prices will mostly settle around 7–8 cents, even as the frost intensifies.
