*The electricity market is expected to see fluctuating prices in the coming week, with Sunday and Thursday standing out as potential peak price days. Monday, on the other hand, offers the most affordable prices thanks to strong wind power production.*

Loviisa 1 nuclear power plant is undergoing maintenance, which started on 6 September 2025 at 10:00 and is expected to end on 24 September 2025 at 00:00. Loviisa 2 is also under maintenance, starting on 17 August 2025 at 04:00 and ending on 17 September 2025 at 00:00. These maintenance outages may affect the forecast accuracy, as there is limited training data available from periods of maintenance outages.

The coming week is expected to bring fluctuating electricity prices. **Sunday** is anticipated to have an average price of 3.0 ¬¢/kWh, but the highest prices could reach nearly ten cents. This is likely due to low wind power production, which will drop to 900 megawatts in the evening. The most affordable day of the week appears to be **Monday**, with the average price expected to remain below one cent. Wind power production will be strong, which partly explains the more affordable price level.

**Tuesday** and **Wednesday** will maintain low prices, but a slight increase is expected on Wednesday, with an average price of 3.4 ¬¢/kWh. This may be due to a decrease in wind power production on Wednesday afternoon. **Thursday** sees prices rise again, with the day's highest price possibly reaching 7.7 ¬¢/kWh. This may be explained by low wind power production, forecasted to be at a minimum of 1589 megawatts during the day. Prices on Friday and Saturday are expected to be moderate, with wind power production remaining at a generally normal level.

Overall, the week is expected to have variable price trends, but significant price peaks are possible, particularly on Sunday and Thursday.
