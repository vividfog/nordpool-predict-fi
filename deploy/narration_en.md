Prices are expected to diverge over the week. The lowest levels are anticipated on **Sunday** and **Thursday**, with the daily average around 2,7 ¢ and the range holding at 1,1–4,4 ¢. Strong wind output (over 4,000 MW) will support these days. The averages for **Monday**, **Wednesday** and **Saturday** are expected between 5–7 ¢. On **Friday** the average would be about 7,3 ¢, and afternoon hours will reach roughly 12–14 ¢.

The clearest outlier will be on **Tuesday**. The daily average is projected at 12,4 ¢ with a maximum of 22,1 ¢. An elevated risk of intraday price spikes is flagged for this day; the peak would most likely fall between 08:00–10:00. In the background, minimum wind output drops very low, to 589 MW, which helps explain the higher maximum. Toward evening, prices may rise again, roughly 17:00–19:00 above 16 ¢. The cheapest periods are expected during night hours from Sunday to Thursday, when the price often stays below four cents.
