In the coming week, electricity price trends are expected to fluctuate moderately, but a few days stand out. **Thursday** is forecasted to have the week's highest prices, with an average price of 8.5 ¬¢/kWh and a peak price rising to 17.0 ¬¢/kWh. There is also a high risk of price spikes on Thursday during specific hours, which could impact consumer electricity usage. Weak wind power production, especially during morning hours, can partly explain the higher prices on Thursday.

**Sunday** also sees a rise in average electricity prices to 4.6 ¬¢/kWh, with peak prices possibly reaching up to 19.1 ¬¢/kWh. This, combined with low minimum wind power production, which drops to just 528 MW, increases the risk of price spikes. These spikes are expected particularly during evening hours.

The most affordable prices of the week are forecasted for **Saturday**, when the average price will settle at 0.9 ¬¢/kWh. Saturday's price expectations are otherwise steady without significant spikes.

Overall, the week's electricity prices remain reasonable, and the fluctuations between days offer consumers opportunities to time their electricity usage for the most affordable hours. Wind power production is generally expected to be typical, except for a few occasions where it might influence price variability. The forecast promises an interesting week in electricity price trends.
