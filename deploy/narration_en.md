The week will look inexpensive overall, and on most days the average price will sit clearly below four cents. **Thursday** will stand out, as the day’s average is 6,6 ¢ and the maximum will reach 21,6 ¢. The peak will likely occur around 17:00–19:00. The spike will be partly explained by Thursday’s very low minimum wind output (736 MW), while early in the week production will be clearly higher. On **Saturday**, a public holiday, the price level will look moderate: average 6,6 ¢ with highs at 11,5 ¢.

The cheapest days will be **Sunday** (avg 1,0 ¢) and **Friday** (avg 1,1 ¢). Prices will briefly turn negative on Sunday early morning at 01:00–03:00 and on Friday at 02:00–04:00. On **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, prices will mostly stay around 1–2 ¢, supported by abundant wind power. **Monday** will sit in between with a 5,0 ¢ average. The cheapest hours will typically fall in late evenings and early mornings, while Thursday’s most expensive moments will hit the evening peak.
