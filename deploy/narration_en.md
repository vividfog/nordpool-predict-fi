The weekâ€™s price path will diverge: **Friday** and **Saturday** will rise above the other days, and isolated spikes are expected. On Friday, peak hours will land around 17:00â€“19:00, with a forecast maximum of 17,4 Â¢. The dayâ€™s minimum wind output will drop to 414 MW, which would explain the higher peak. On Saturday, a public holiday, the average will hold at 7,1 Â¢, but spike risk will concentrate around 08:00â€“10:00 (peak 14,2 Â¢). Minimum wind output will fall to 160 MW, which may accentuate the morning high-price hours.

**Sunday** will be very low: an average of 0,8 Â¢ and a minimum of -0,7 Â¢. Several negative-price periods are likely during the night and early morning. **Monday** will average 4,6 Â¢. **Tuesday** and **Wednesday** will stay low (3,1 Â¢ and 1,0 Â¢), and **Thursday** around 2,9 Â¢. These days will be supported by strong winds, which are expected to weigh on prices. The cheapest moments of the week will cluster on Sunday night, while the most expensive hours will fall on Friday evening.
