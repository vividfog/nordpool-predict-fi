The start of the week will stand out as clearly more expensive. **Monday** will average 11,7 ¢ and a price-spike risk is expected to fall in the morning, within the 08:00–10:00 window. **Tuesday** will rise to a 14,0 ¢ average and a 22,0 ¢ maximum, with another spike anticipated at 08:00–10:00. **Wednesday** will be the clearest peak day of the week: the average will be 15,0 ¢ and the day’s high 22,3 ¢. The day’s minimum wind output will drop to 1761 MW, which explains the higher maximum price. A second highlight on Wednesday will appear in the early evening around 17:00–19:00. The spike risk is explicitly noted for these three days.

Later in the week, levels will drop clearly. **Thursday** will average 8,8 ¢, **Friday** 3,7 ¢, **Saturday** 2,6 ¢ and **Sunday** 3,9 ¢. Strong winds from Thursday onward will support the low price level. The week’s most affordable hours will mostly fall in the night and early morning from Friday to Sunday, when prices will repeatedly dip below four cents and down to about 1,5–2,3 ¢ at the lowest. During daytime over the weekend, prices will largely stay within a 3–5 cent range.
