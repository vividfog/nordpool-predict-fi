| **Monday** | 12,5 | 5,3 - 20,9 | 1081 - 3430 | 4,0 |
| **Tuesday** | 8,8 | 4,1 - 20,4 | 1441 - 4064 | 3,6 |
| **Wednesday** | 3,5 | 2,1 - 6,1 | 3835 - 4779 | 5,0 |
| **Thursday** | 6,8 | 1,7 - 11,8 | 1681 - 4144 | 6,3 |
| **Friday** | 5,3 | 2,5 - 9,0 | 1639 - 3206 | 7,5 |
| **Saturday** | 11,5 | 6,0 - 21,8 | 907 - 4325 | 5,2 |
| **Sunday** | 5,6 | 3,1 - 8,3 | 3839 - 5358 | 4,7 |

The week’s clearest outlier will already appear in **Saturday’s** prices. The average would settle at 11.5 cents, and the daily peak would rise to 21.8¢, most likely in the morning between 8–10. Wind power’s minimum output would drop the same day to 907 megawatts, which would explain the highest maximum price. The spike risk would be pronounced in single hours.

**Monday’s** average would also be elevated, at 12.5 cents. The peak is anticipated in the evening between 18–20, with a maximum of 20.9¢. Weak average wind generation (1,883 MW) would support the higher price level. **Tuesday’s** average would be lower, but intraday volatility would be large, with the peak likely in the morning between 8–10 (20.4¢). Both days are assessed to carry a heightened spike risk.

Price dynamics would even out markedly on **Wednesday**, when the average would drop to 3.5 cents and the day’s range would remain narrow (2.1–6.1¢). Strong wind (average 4,427 MW) would support the low level. **Sunday’s** average would remain moderate (5.6¢) with a tight range. These days would be characterized by steadiness without separate spike markers.

Later in the week, **Thursday’s** and **Friday’s** levels would sit in the middle ground. Thursday’s peak would likely occur in the evening between 18–20 (11.8¢), and Friday’s similarly between 18–20 (9.0¢). Both days are assessed to have single-hour spike risk, though the levels would remain clearly below the early-week peaks. The week’s cheapest hours would likely land in the early hours of Thursday between 2–4, when the price would dip to about 1.7¢.

In the overall weekly picture, the most expensive moments would show up on Saturday morning as well as in **Monday’s** and **Tuesday’s** evening and morning highs. The cheapest stretches would cluster throughout Wednesday and into Thursday night-time hours, and Friday morning would also stay low. Strong variation in wind output would explain most of the intraday swings, especially when the minimum drops below 2,000 MW.
