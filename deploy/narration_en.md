In the upcoming week, electricity price trends appear to have slight variations. **Wednesday** and **Saturday** are expected to be the cheapest days, with average prices slightly negative. This is partly explained by strong wind power, exceeding 4500 MW on Wednesday. **Friday**, on the other hand, stands out with a higher average price of 1.0 ¬¢/kWh, but the price expectations within the day vary significantly.

**Sunday** and next **Monday** are expected to have higher price expectations. Sunday's average price will settle at 1.6 cents, and Monday's at 2.0 cents per kilowatt-hour. There is also a possibility of price spikes during certain hours on Sunday and Monday. On Sunday, clear price peaks are seen in the hourly forecast during the morning and evening hours, such as 19-21. Price spikes may also occur on Monday, especially in the afternoon and early evening.

The weekend's wind power production seems weaker, which could partly elevate the price. On Sunday, wind power's minimum production drops to 719 MW, which could partly contribute to the price rise. Overall, the forecast points to fluctuating price trends, with variations in wind power production playing a significant role.
