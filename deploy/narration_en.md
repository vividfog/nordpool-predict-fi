The upcoming week presents varying electricity price forecasts. **Tuesday** and **Wednesday** appear particularly affordable, with average prices hovering around zero. This is partly due to strong wind power production, which exceeds 4600 MW on Wednesday. **Thursday** sees a slightly wider price range, but the average price remains negative.

**Friday** sees a slight increase in price levels, with an average price of 1.0 cents. Wind power production remains low, which may partly explain the price rise. **Saturday** features moderate winds, and prices are again low. Sunday, on the other hand, brings price spikes, especially in the afternoon when prices could rise to nearly five cents. This is due to low wind power production, falling below 1000 MW.

Next **Monday**, the price trend continues similar to Sunday, with an average price rising to 2.3 cents. Wind power production remains low, which may explain the higher prices. Therefore, the weekend and the beginning of the week appear to be more expensive periods, while the midweek offers more affordable prices.
