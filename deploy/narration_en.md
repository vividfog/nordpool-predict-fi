There is a production deficit at the Olkiluoto 2 nuclear power plant, which began on 15.8.2025 at 07:00 and will end on 15.8.2025 at 12:00. This may affect the accuracy of the forecast, as the data available during maintenance outages is limited.

Electricity price expectations vary significantly in the coming days. **On Saturday** and **Sunday**, the price level remains affordable, with an average price of less than two cents per kilowatt-hour. The highest price rises to 5.5 Â¢ on Sunday evening. The wind power production on these days is high, which partly explains the low prices.

**On Monday**, price expectations rise, with the average price reaching 5.3 Â¢. There may be price spikes during individual hours, especially in the morning and evening. Wind power production is predicted to be low in the morning, which raises the price particularly between 8-10 a.m.

**On Wednesday**, the average price is slightly higher than at the beginning of the week, at 3.2 Â¢. There is also a risk of price spikes during this day, but it is not as significant as on Monday. **On Thursday**, the price level continues to rise, with the average price reaching 4.1 Â¢. On Friday, the high average price of 7.5 Â¢ reflects a greater risk of price spikes. Prices are expected to rise particularly in the morning.
