*Electricity price expectations vary in the coming week, especially with higher prices on Tuesday and Thursday, while Sunday is anticipated to have cheaper prices as wind power production increases.*

The Loviisa 2 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance. The maintenance began on August 17, 2025, at 04:00 and is expected to end on September 6, 2025, at 00:00. This may affect the forecast accuracy as training data is limited during maintenance periods.

The forecast was updated on Monday at 12:07.

Electricity price expectations for the upcoming week vary significantly. **Tuesday** is expected to see high prices, with an average price rising to 8.6 ¬¢/kWh and a maximum price potentially reaching 18.4 ¬¢. This could be due to low wind power production at certain hours. **Thursday** might see even higher prices, with the average price forecasted at 10.7 ¬¢/kWh and a maximum price of up to 22.3 ¬¢. Wind power production is forecasted to be low, which may impact price spikes.

The lowest electricity prices of the week are anticipated on **Sunday**, when the average price might be 3.5 ¬¢/kWh. Wind power production will be at its highest, which can help lower prices. Over the weekend, prices remain moderate, but there is a risk of price spikes during certain hours, particularly in the afternoon.

Next **Monday**, electricity prices might rise again, especially in the evening, with a maximum price potentially reaching 17.4 ¬¢/kWh. This could be related to low wind power production during the evening hours. Electricity users should therefore prepare for possible price fluctuations throughout the week.
