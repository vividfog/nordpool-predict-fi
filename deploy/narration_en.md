At the start of the week, the price level will remain clearly elevated. The highest daily average price is expected on **Monday**, when the average will settle at 16.5 cents and the day’s highest hourly price will rise to 33.0 cents. Monday’s peak will fall in the morning, around 7–9. At the same time, wind power will drop very low during the day, and the minimum will dip to 724 megawatts. This combination will explain the high maximum price. Severe frost will continue, because average temperatures will stay well below -5 degrees on **Saturday** and early in the week.

The risk of price spikes will stand out on **Sunday**, when the most expensive period of the day will fall around 10–12, and on **Tuesday**, when peak hours will fall around 10–12. On **Wednesday**, the risk will be tied especially to late morning, around 10–12. Later in the week, the price level will fall. On **Thursday**, the average price will drop to 6.7 cents, and on **Friday** the expectation will fall below four cents, as the day’s range remains 1.5–4.8 cents.
