| **Wednesday** | 1,0 | -0,1 - 1,7 | 2665 - 4889 | 6,9 |
| **Thursday** | 4,7 | 0,3 - 11,4 | 2072 - 4324 | 7,1 |
| **Friday** | 7,1 | 1,5 - 15,1 | 673 - 3271 | 6,6 |

| **Monday** | 5,8 | 1,6 - 10,4 | 2391 - 3180 | 3,1 |
| **Tuesday** | 12,4 | 3,2 - 21,9 | 708 - 2485 | 1,2 |

The week will start off inexpensive. Already on **Wednesday** the average price will be about 1,0 ¢, with a brief dip below zero at night (around 02:00–04:00). Thursday will still remain under five cents. After **Friday** the level will vary: Saturday’s average will fall back to a low 2,0 ¢, and Sunday — a public holiday — will be a moderate 3,3 ¢. Next Monday the average will rise to 5,8 ¢. The standout day will be next **Tuesday**, when the average will climb to 12,4 ¢ and the day’s highest hour is forecast at 21,9 ¢.

Spike hours are anticipated on two days. On **Friday** the peaks will cluster in the morning, roughly 08:00–10:00. Weak wind (average 1448 MW) could support a higher price level, and a single peak hour could exceed the forecast. Next **Tuesday** the peaks will lean toward the morning 08:00–10:00 and the evening 17:00–19:00. Tuesday’s exceptionally low minimum wind output (708 MW) will help explain the higher maximum, and the realized peak could be costlier than expected.
