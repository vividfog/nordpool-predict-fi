In the coming week, electricity prices will vary significantly. **On Monday**, the highest average price of the week is expected at 13.6 cents/kWh, with prices within the day expected to range up to 31.8 cents. This is due to low wind power production, which is occasionally below 1000 MW. **On Tuesday**, prices remain high, with an average of 12.8 cents/kWh, and there is a significant risk of price spikes at certain hours.

**On Wednesday** and **Thursday**, prices drop significantly, with average prices remaining below five cents. Wind power is particularly abundant on Wednesday, which partly explains the price decrease. **On Friday**, prices drop further, with the average price being only 3.7 ¢/kWh, and as the weekend approaches, prices continue to decrease. **On Saturday** and **Sunday**, prices remain low, with Sunday expected to have the lowest average price of the week at 1.9 cents/kWh.

Throughout the week, wind power production varies significantly, reflecting in the electricity price trends as well. The lowest wind power production is on Monday, which partly raises the prices for that day. **On Tuesday**, the risk of price spikes is significant, so consumers should be prepared for potentially high hourly prices. **On Wednesday** and **Thursday**, the abundant supply of wind power helps keep prices low.
