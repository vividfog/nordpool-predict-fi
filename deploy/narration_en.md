The lowest daily averages would be seen **on Sunday** (4,1 ¢) and **on Monday** (3,7 ¢), with strong wind output on those days weighing on prices. On Monday, wind would average above 4000 MW. Cheap hours would occur on several nights, especially into Monday and Tuesday. **Tuesday’s** average would rise to 5,7 ¢, with a gentle rise from afternoon into early evening. The weekend would be pricier mainly due to a few morning hours, as the wind base level stays low.
