*Next week's electricity market anticipates significant price fluctuations as variations in wind power production and the risk of price spikes influence daily price trends. Thursday stands out as the most expensive day of the week.*

Loviisa 2 nuclear power plant is undergoing maintenance, which began on August 17, 2025, and is expected to end on September 8, 2025. During this period, the plant's availability is zero percent, and this may affect forecast accuracy since training data is limited during maintenance periods.

**Saturday** offers a low average price, but price spikes may occur during individual hours. Prices on **Sunday** and **Monday** are expected to rise significantly, partly due to lower wind power generation. There is also a high risk of price spikes on these days, particularly during the morning and evening hours.

**Tuesday** sees prices return to more moderate levels, while **Wednesday** is expected to see higher prices again, particularly in the evening. **Thursday** continues this trend, with its average price being the highest of the week. **Friday's** forecast promises more affordable prices again, but afternoon hours may see spikes.

The week's price expectations vary significantly, with **Thursday** standing out as the most expensive day. Fluctuations in wind power production strongly impact price formation, clearly reflected in the price range across different days of the week.
