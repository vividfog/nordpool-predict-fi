*The coming week brings fluctuating electricity prices as wind power production and price spikes influence costs. Sunday and Wednesday prices stand out, while Saturday is expected to offer cheaper electricity rates.*

The Loviisa nuclear power plant unit 2 is undergoing maintenance. Its nominal output is 496.0 MW, but currently, the available power is 0 MW, meaning the availability percentage is 0.0. The maintenance started on August 17, 2025, at 04:00 and is expected to end on September 6, 2025, at 00:00. This maintenance may affect the forecast's accuracy, as historical data from maintenance periods is limited.

The forecast was updated on Saturday at 21:06.

In the upcoming week, electricity prices will vary significantly. **Sunday** stands out with its higher average price of 8.6 ¢/kWh and a maximum price of 13.9 ¢. Wind power production is at a low level on Sunday, which may partially explain the higher prices. **Monday** offers more affordable prices, with an average of 4.0 ¢, although there is a risk of price spikes. **Tuesday** and **Wednesday** appear to be more expensive days, especially on Wednesday, when the maximum price rises to 18.9 ¢.

**Thursday** seems more moderate in terms of price development, but still higher than Monday, and **Friday** continues a slightly upward price trend, even though the highest price remains below Wednesday's level. **Saturday**, in turn, offers the cheapest prices of the week, with an average of only 2.9 ¢. High wind power production is expected to drive Saturday's prices to a low level.

Price spikes may occur especially on Tuesday and Wednesday, during morning and evening hours. This is important to consider when planning electricity usage on those days.
