In the upcoming week, electricity prices are expected to vary significantly on different days. **Thursday** is expected to maintain prices near zero, possibly due to strong wind power averaging over 3000 MW. **Friday** sees an increase in price expectations, with a risk of price spikes during the day. This could be due to the low wind power output that fluctuates significantly throughout the day.

**Saturday** and **Sunday** are expected to have moderate prices, though individual hours may see spikes. On Sunday, the daily maximum price is 4.4¬¢, which is higher than other weekend days, coinciding with lower wind power production.

Next **Monday** and **Wednesday**, prices are expected to rise slightly higher but remain reasonable. Wednesday's maximum price is 5.9¬¢, the highest of the week, yet still far from sharp price hikes. Wind power production remains lower on these days, potentially contributing to price increases.

Overall, the week's price trend may bring surprises, particularly in the form of individual hour price spikes, but generally, prices remain reasonable. On average, the upcoming week's price level is affordable, with no major deviations expected.
