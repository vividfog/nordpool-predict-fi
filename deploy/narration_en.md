Electricity market prices in the coming days will see noticeable fluctuations. The overall price level will decline towards the weekend, but temporary price spikes may occur on Thursday and Friday.

On **Wednesday**, price variation will be significant. The average electricity price will be around eight cents. However, the day will see clear differences, with prices dropping to as low as 1.4 cents in the early morning hours and peaking above 15 cents between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m.

On **Thursday**, the price situation will remain similar. The average price will be slightly lower than Wednesday, around 7.4 cents. Nevertheless, the risk of price spikes on Thursday will be significant, as wind power production will fall to as low as 210 megawatts. Highest prices will occur around eight in the morning, when prices could momentarily exceed 15 cents.

On **Friday**, the price level will continue to decrease. The average price will stay below five cents, although individual price spikes may still occur in the morning hours. Between 8 and 10 a.m., prices will rise above 11 cents due to reduced wind power production during morning hours.

During the weekend, prices will become extremely affordable. On **Saturday**, the average electricity price will remain below one cent and occasionally close to zero. Price levels will remain very stable throughout the day, without significant fluctuations. On **Sunday**, electricity prices will slightly increase from Saturday's levels, but will still remain modest. The average price will be two cents, with peak prices clearly below five cents.

At the beginning of the next week, prices will rise moderately. On **Monday** and **Tuesday**, prices will be slightly higher than during the weekend, yet still reasonable. Monday's highest price will be slightly above nine cents, and Tuesday's peak around ten cents.
