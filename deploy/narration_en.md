In the coming week, electricity prices are expected to vary considerably between days. **Monday's** average price is slightly higher, with a risk of price spikes, especially in the morning and evening when prices may rise above six cents. Wind power production is at its lowest then, which may partly explain the higher prices.

On **Tuesday**, the price level drops significantly, with the average price remaining around one cent. This is partly due to abundant wind power availability, keeping prices low. **Wednesday** sees a slight increase from Tuesday's levels but remains reasonable. There is also a risk of price spikes on Wednesday, particularly in the afternoon.

**Thursday** and **Friday** continue with reasonable price levels, but especially on Friday, higher prices are expected as wind power production is at its lowest. Prices drop again over the weekend, with Sunday possibly seeing negative prices overnight. The risk of price spikes is low over the weekend, but there may be isolated spikes on Sunday.

Overall, the week's price development is variable, with particular caution needed for potential price spikes on Monday and Friday. The cheapest prices of the week are expected on Tuesday, supported by the high availability of wind power.
