**Saturday** and **Sunday** will be affordable days, as the average prices remain negative. Wind power production will be at a high level during the weekend, explaining the low prices. On Saturday, prices will range between -0.8 and 0.6 cents, and on Sunday, between -0.6 and 1.5 cents.

**Monday** will see a slight increase in prices, but they will remain at a reasonable level with an average price of 2.8 ¬¢/kWh. Tuesday will show greater variation, with prices ranging widely between 0.1 and 12.0 cents. This may be due to fluctuations in wind power production, as daily production varies between 2077 MW and 4284 MW.

**Wednesday** will see a clear rise in prices, with an average price reaching 6.5 ¬¢/kWh. This will be the highest average price of the week, with wind power production at its lowest. Price spikes may occur during individual hours, so caution is advised on Wednesday.

**Thursday** and **Friday** will see prices decrease again. Thursday's average price will be 3.9 ¬¢/kWh, and Friday's 2.8 ¬¢/kWh. On both days, wind power production will be at a moderate level, smoothing out price fluctuations.

Overall, the week will show a clear increase in prices from the beginning of the week through Wednesday, after which prices will stabilize towards the end of the week. Wednesday stands out as a higher day, where the low wind power production affects the price level.
