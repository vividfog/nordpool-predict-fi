Electricity prices will mostly remain affordable during the next few days, although price fluctuations will occur throughout the week. Negative prices will be most evident on **Friday**, when the lowest hourly rate will drop to -1.2 cents. Early morning hours, especially from 03:00 to 05:00, will see clearly negative prices. With an average daily price around zero cents, Friday will be the cheapest day of the week for electricity users.

On **Saturday**, price levels will rise slightly compared to Friday. The day's average price will increase to 2.9 cents, and in the morning between 07:00‚Äì09:00, as well as in the evening between 19:00‚Äì21:00, electricity prices could peak above 8 cents. Saturday's risk of high price peaks is related to low wind power production, reaching as low as 280 MW.

On **Sunday**, the average electricity price will remain moderate at 1.9 cents. The day's minimum price will dip slightly negative in the afternoon between 14:00‚Äì16:00, reaching -0.3 cents. In the evening between 19:00‚Äì21:00, electricity prices will peak above 6 cents, raising the possibility of individual price spikes.

Next week's most expensive day will be **Monday**, when the average electricity price climbs to 4.5 cents. The highest hourly rate, 10.1 cents, will occur in the evening between 19:00‚Äì21:00. Monday's price increase is partly explained by relatively low wind power production, at most 1205 MW during the day.

On **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, average prices will remain reasonable, around 3.4 cents on both days. Tuesday's price fluctuations will be moderate, with no significant risk of price spikes. Wednesday will see slightly greater price variation; the price will rise above 7 cents in the morning between 08:00‚Äì10:00, making isolated peak hours possible.
