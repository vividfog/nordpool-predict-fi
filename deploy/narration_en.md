Next week's electricity price forecast will show more variation than usual between days. The week's lowest prices will clearly occur on Sunday and Saturday, with average prices hovering around zero or even dipping into negative territory. **Sunday's** average price will be -0,3 cents, with the lowest price reaching -2,7 cents in the afternoon between 14:00–16:00. On **Saturday**, the average price will be 0,3 cents, with the lowest prices dropping to -1,3 cents in the morning around 10:00–12:00.

The week's highest prices will be seen on **Thursday**, when the daily average climbs to 4,2 cents. On Thursday, price peaks will occur in the evening between about 18:00–20:00, reaching a maximum of 9,6 cents. Higher peak prices will also appear on **Tuesday**, especially in the evening between 19:00–21:00, when electricity prices will reach up to 7,3 cents. Tuesday's average price will be 3,0 cents.

On **Monday**, price fluctuations will also be notable, with electricity prices ranging from negative numbers during the early morning to a 3,8-cent peak around 8:00–10:00. Monday's average price remains moderate at 0,9 cents.

In the middle of the week, on **Wednesday**, prices will remain relatively stable. Wednesday's average price will be 2,1 cents, with no particularly high peaks expected. On **Friday**, the price level will also remain moderate, with an average price of 1,1 cents and no significant price spikes.

Generally, the week's highest prices will tend to occur around morning and early evening hours, while nighttime and afternoon hours will offer cheaper electricity. Daily large variations in prices are partly explained by fluctuating wind power production; particularly on Tuesday, the minimum wind power generation will be low (601 MW), partly explaining that day's higher maximum price.
