The average price is expected to be 9.5 cents per kilowatt-hour, with a risk of price spikes during certain hours. **On Friday**, the price level drops significantly, with an average price of only 4.0 cents, due to strong wind power, which is expected to average over 4000 MW.

Wind power remains variable but does not significantly impact the price level. **On Monday**, price expectations rise slightly, with the average price settling at 5.4 cents. By Wednesday, the risk of price spikes returns, particularly in the afternoon and evening hours, when the maximum price could rise to 14.2 cents.
