The upcoming week appears relatively stable in terms of electricity prices, with a few notable features. **Monday** offers the lowest prices, with an average of 3.1 ¬¢/kWh. Prices are expected to remain low throughout the day, making it the most affordable day at the start of the week.

**Tuesday** and **Thursday** are expected to see slightly higher average prices, around 4 ¬¢/kWh. There is also a risk of price spikes on Tuesday, particularly in the evening, where prices could reach up to 10 ¬¢/kWh. This may be linked to the low wind power production expected on Tuesday morning.

For the weekend, **Saturday** and **Sunday** stand out with lower prices. **Sunday** is forecasted to have the week's lowest prices, with an average of just 1.3 ¬¢/kWh. This could be due to higher wind power production on Sunday, which stabilizes price fluctuations throughout the day.

In summary, the price trend for the coming week is quite moderate, without major deviations or dramatic price swings. Prices remain mostly under four cents, providing consumers the opportunity to take advantage of affordable electricity on multiple days.
