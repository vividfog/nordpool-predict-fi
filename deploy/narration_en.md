The week will start off inexpensive: **Sunday** is expected to average 2,6 ¢, and at night prices will hover around zero. Wind power will be plentiful, which will support the low level. **Monday** is expected to be the week’s highest: an average of 10,1 ¢ and a peak of 17,2 ¢. The day’s minimum wind output drops to 839 MW, which explains the higher maximum price. The risk of price spikes will stand out on Monday, with the peak expected in the evening around 17:00–19:00.

**Tuesday** is forecast to average 9,1 ¢. Isolated spikes may appear in the late morning around 10:00–12:00. **Wednesday** is a public holiday; the average will be 8,0 ¢, but spike risk will relate to the evening around 17:00–19:00. **Thursday** is also a public holiday, and the average price will ease to 6,1 ¢. **Friday** (public holiday) is projected to be among the week’s cheapest at 2,7 ¢. **Saturday** will continue near the same level, 2,7 ¢. Strong wind from Thursday onward will support the low end of prices.
