Electricity price expectations will stay moderate throughout the week. Daily averages will sit between 3,6–8,3 ¢. The lowest averages will fall on **Monday** (3,6 ¢) and **Friday** (4,1 ¢), which will coincide with plenty of wind power. The week’s highest daily average will be expected on **Wednesday** (8,3 ¢).

Intraday highlights will focus on **Tuesday** and **Saturday**. A Tuesday morning peak will be expected around 08:00–10:00, when the price will reach 11,1 ¢; weak wind output (average 2272 MW) will contribute. On **Saturday** the highest price will occur around 15:00–17:00, about 13,7 ¢. The elevated Saturday peak will be explained by an exceptionally low wind minimum (976 MW). The week’s lowest hourly prices will likely come early Saturday, around 02:00–05:00, near 1–2 ¢. Otherwise prices will mostly remain within the 2–8 ¢ range.
