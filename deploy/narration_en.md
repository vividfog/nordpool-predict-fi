The upcoming week's electricity price trend is variable, with several price spikes expected. **Saturday** has the highest average price at approximately 11.0 cents per kilowatt-hour, with prices potentially rising to 20.0 cents during the day. This is due to low wind power production, which may drive up maximum prices.

On **Sunday**, the price level is expected to be lower, averaging 4.6 cents, with a minimum price of 1.5 cents. This is the lowest average price of the week, and wind power production is generally higher, which may explain the more affordable prices.

On **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, price expectations are similar, with an average price of about 9.3 cents. Price spikes are also anticipated on these days during individual hours, with the most variability likely during the day as wind power production fluctuates.

Overall, the price trend throughout the week is diverse, with Saturday standing out for its higher prices. Electricity consumers should be prepared for possible price fluctuations, especially in the mornings and evenings.
