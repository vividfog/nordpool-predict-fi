In the coming week, electricity prices will show significant fluctuations, especially on **Monday**, when both the average and maximum prices are expected to be higher than on other days. The day is anticipated to start with a price spike around 9 AM, potentially reaching up to 27.6 cents. This is partly due to low wind power production during the morning hours. On **Tuesday**, prices will drop significantly, but the risk of price spikes remains, with the maximum price potentially rising in the evening.

From **Wednesday** onward, prices are expected to remain more moderate, with Thursday and Friday appearing to be the most affordable days of the week, with average prices staying below 5 cents. Wind power production on these days is fairly typical, contributing to stable price levels.

The weekend brings further price fluctuations, particularly on **Saturday**, when the average price rises to 7.6 cents. Saturday evening may bring a price spike around 7 PM. On Sunday, prices remain reasonable, but the possibility of price spikes still exists, especially in the afternoon.
