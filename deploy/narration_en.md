| **Tuesday**   | 6.5 | 0.5 - 18.5 | 2023 - 3596 | 11.1 |

| **Saturday**  | 0.6 | -0.6 - 2.3 | 3634 - 4666 | 10.3 |

Significant fluctuations in electricity prices are anticipated for the upcoming week. **Wednesday** stands out with its highest average price of 11.1 cents and a maximum price of 23.2 cents, making it the most expensive day of the week. This is partly due to the wind power minimum being only 1030 MW, which contributes to higher price levels. The risk of price spikes is high on Wednesday, potentially pushing prices even higher than forecasted.

**Tuesday** is another day when price spikes are possible. The maximum price reaches 18.5 cents, with an average price of 6.5 cents. The wind power minimum is slightly higher than on Wednesday, but it remains low, potentially causing price fluctuations.

The most affordable days of the week are **Saturday** and **Monday**, with notably low average prices of 0.6 and 2.9 cents. On Saturday, prices even drop into negative territory during nighttime hours, which is rare but possible.

Overall, the coming week offers varying price expectations, with particularly high prices on Wednesday and low prices over the weekend creating a clear contrast. The availability of wind power significantly affects price fluctuations, especially when production is low.
