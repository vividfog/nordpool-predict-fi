In the upcoming week, electricity price expectations vary moderately, but the average price remains mostly low. **Monday** stands out with the highest average price of 2.5 cents per kilowatt-hour, with the day's maximum price reaching 6.2 cents. This may be explained by the low minimum wind power production, which is only 1185 megawatts. The highest individual price on **Monday** is reached in the evening at 8 PM.

**On Tuesday**, the average electricity price drops significantly to 0.7 cents per kilowatt-hour. Wind power production is strong, averaging 3544 megawatts, which partly explains the low prices. **On Wednesday**, prices remain even lower, averaging 0.2 cents per kilowatt-hour, and wind power continues its strong production.

**Thursday's** average price rises slightly to 1.1 cents per kilowatt-hour, but wind power production remains sufficient, limiting price increases. **On Friday**, the risk of price spikes increases, with the day's maximum price potentially rising to 6.3 cents. This may be due to low wind power production, especially during the early morning hours between 2 and 4 AM. **Saturday** and **Sunday** continue with the risk of price spikes, but average prices remain moderate at 1.2 and 0.2 cents, respectively.
