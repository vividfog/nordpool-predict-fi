*This week’s electricity prices will stay low from Wednesday through Saturday, with Friday–Saturday very low; from Sunday they rise, and Monday–Tuesday face spike risk due to weak wind.*

|:-------------|:----------------:|:----------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| **Wednesday** | 5,3 | 1,2 - 8,2 | 2267 - 3876 | 0,1 |
| **Thursday** | 3,4 | 1,8 - 6,9 | 1602 - 6382 | 1,1 |
| **Friday** | 1,5 | 0,5 - 2,4 | 4340 - 6077 | 2,1 |
| **Saturday** | 1,3 | -0,2 - 3,5 | 3614 - 5914 | 3,3 |
| **Sunday** | 5,4 | 2,2 - 8,6 | 1716 - 3812 | 2,9 |
| **Monday** | 9,7 | 5,1 - 15,8 | 873 - 1611 | 2,2 |
| **Tuesday** | 10,2 | 4,5 - 15,9 | 1116 - 1990 | 1,5 |

Prices over the week would show a clear split. From **Wednesday** onward the level would be moderate, and the cheapest stretch would fall on **Friday** and **Saturday**, with averages well below four cents. On Saturday prices would briefly turn negative (lowest -0.2 ¢). Thursday’s and Saturday’s low prices would be explained by strong wind generation, which would stay long above 3,000 MW. On **Sunday** the average would rise to 5.4 ¢, and the evening hours would be clearly pricier than early week.

Next **Monday** and **Tuesday** the price level would climb into clearly expensive territory: averages 9.7 ¢ and 10.2 ¢, and daily maxima above 15 ¢. Monday’s peak would most likely occur at 17:00–19:00 (forecast peak 18:00), and Tuesday’s morning peak at 8:00–10:00 (forecast peak 9:00). Both days would share weak wind: wind minima would fall below 2,000 MW, which would explain the higher prices in individual hours. Tuesday’s forecast maximum would be the week’s highest, even though the average would stay close to Monday’s level.
