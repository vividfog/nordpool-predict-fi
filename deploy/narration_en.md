Significant price fluctuations are expected in the electricity market in the coming week. Higher average prices are anticipated on **Tuesday** and **Monday**, compared to other days of the week. On **Monday** in particular, a high price is forecasted, with a maximum price potentially reaching up to 23.1 ¬¢. This is due to the low minimum wind power production, which stands at 1339 MW, potentially contributing to the price increase.

The most affordable prices of the week are expected on **Friday** and **Sunday**, with average prices dropping to 2.8 ¬¢ and 2.4 ¬¢, respectively. On these days, wind power production is at a relatively good level, which may help keep prices low. **Wednesday** and **Thursday** also offer moderate price expectations, with average prices below 5 ¬¢.

Price spikes may occur especially on **Tuesday**, where individual hours can significantly raise the electricity price. **Thursday** also carries a slight risk of price spikes. On **Monday**, price spikes are likely, potentially occurring during morning or evening hours, when electricity consumption is traditionally higher.

Weather conditions for the week are not expected to significantly impact electricity prices, as forecasted temperatures remain within the cool weather range. Thus, electricity prices are expected to be primarily determined by wind power production and consumption.
