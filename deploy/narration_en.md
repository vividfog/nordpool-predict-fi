A low price level is anticipated for the start of the week. From **Tuesday** to **Saturday** average prices will stay between 0,2â€“1,6 Â¢, and especially on **Wednesday** as well as **Thursday** and **Saturday** negative hours are expected at night. Strong winds through most of this stretch are set to support subdued prices.

**Sunday** will stand out as clearly more expensive than the early week: the average will be 3,2 Â¢ and the dayâ€™s high 7,2 Â¢. The wind power minimum will dip to 1646 MW, clearly below 2000 MW, which helps explain the higher maximum compared with other days. The morning hours, around 07:00â€“09:00, are expected to carry an elevated spike risk.

**Monday** will see prices rise further. The average will land at 5,2 Â¢ and intraday variability will increase: in the evening, around 18:00â€“20:00, some of the weekâ€™s highest readings are forecast, with the top hour reaching 9,6 Â¢. Wind will then be roughly at a normal level and will not by itself explain the development.

The cheapest moments of the week will most likely occur during the negative night and early-morning hours on **Wednesday**, **Thursday** and **Saturday**. The clearly priciest periods will cluster toward the end of the weekend and the start of the following week, as Sunday morning and especially Monday evening are set to post the higher forecasted levels.
