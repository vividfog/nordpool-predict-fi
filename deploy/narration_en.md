The weekly price trend will be inexpensive especially on **Saturday**, with the average staying at 2.4 ¢. Moderate prices are also expected on **Thursday** and **Sunday**, and slightly higher on **Friday**. The level will rise clearly on **Monday** (avg 10.1 ¢) and further on **Tuesday** (avg 13.3 ¢), after which it will settle on **Wednesday** close to four cents. **Sunday** is a public holiday, which may ease demand and show up as a slightly lower price level.

The highest single price expectation will occur on **Tuesday** morning: a maximum of 23.6 ¢ is forecast around 08:00–10:00, linked to the day’s very low minimum wind output (983 MW). Also on **Monday**, a spike would fall around late afternoon to early evening, roughly 17:00–19:00, when the price would reach 18.8 ¢. Spike risk is also noted on **Friday** in the early evening (around 17:00–19:00) and on **Sunday** in the morning (around 08:00–10:00). The moderate prices on Saturday and Wednesday will be supported by abundant wind power, visible as high average production.
