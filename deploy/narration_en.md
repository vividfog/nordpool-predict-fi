*The electricity price outlook for next week is generally favorable, but the higher price levels on Wednesday and Thursday stand out due to fluctuations in wind power production, which may cause significant price spikes at times.*

In the coming week, electricity prices will vary somewhat, but they remain mostly low. **Monday** and **Tuesday** will see low prices, with the average price being under two cents per kilowatt-hour. On these days, wind power production will be strong, partly explaining the low prices.

Wednesday will bring noticeably higher prices, with the average price rising slightly above five cents. On this day, wind power production will be at a lower level, which could increase prices. **Thursday** will continue the trend of higher prices, with the average price approaching eight cents. A high maximum price is also forecasted for this day, possibly due to low minimum wind power production. Thursday's price spikes may occur during morning and evening hours.

**Friday** will see prices return to moderate levels, and over the weekend, prices will remain steady. On Saturday and Sunday, electricity supply will be firmly at an average level, with prices fluctuating throughout the day but without major spikes expected.

In summary, the coming week's electricity prices will be mostly favorable, but Wednesday and Thursday will stand out as more expensive days. Consumers should be aware of potential price spikes during these days.
