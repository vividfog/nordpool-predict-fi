Electricity prices during the coming week will remain generally affordable. Prices will vary from day to day, but overall the week will be quite inexpensive for consumers. The range of price fluctuations will be relatively large, with the cheapest day's average price being as low as 0.1 cents per kilowatt-hour, while the most expensive day's average will reach 4.5 cents per kilowatt-hour.

The lowest prices of the week will be seen on **Saturday**, when the average price will drop to only 0.1 cents per kilowatt-hour. Saturday will also feature the week's lowest individual hourly price (-1.8 ¢), occurring during the morning hours between 9–11. Negative prices will also appear on **Monday** and **Friday**, especially during nighttime and early morning hours.

The week's most expensive day will be **Thursday**, with an average price of 4.5 cents and a maximum price peaking during the evening between 19–21, reaching as high as 11.7 cents. Prices will also rise noticeably at times on **Tuesday**, when the maximum price will reach 9.1 cents per kilowatt-hour between 19–21. Additionally, individual hours of higher prices are expected on **Wednesday** and **Sunday**.

Fluctuations in wind power production will clearly affect electricity pricing throughout the week. For instance, Tuesday's price peaks will partly result from wind power production dropping significantly at times, down to just over 500 megawatts. Similarly, lower wind power production on Thursday morning and evening will partly explain the highest prices. On Saturday, by contrast, abundant wind power availability will keep prices consistently low throughout the day.

Towards the end of the week, Sunday's average price will settle at a moderate 1.6 cents, though limited wind power production will occasionally raise prices slightly higher. However, Sunday's maximum price will remain moderate at four cents per kilowatt-hour.
