*Electricity prices will fluctuate significantly in the coming week as variations in wind power production impact the markets. Prices remain low on Saturday and Sunday, but from Wednesday onwards, an increase is observed, particularly on Thursday.*

According to the forecast updated on Friday at 09:06, electricity prices in Finland are expected to vary as follows in the coming days:

|            | average<br>price<br>¬¢/kWh | min - max<br>¬¢/kWh | wind power<br>min - max<br>MW | average<br>temperature<br>¬∞C |
|:-----------|:----------------:|:----------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| **Saturday**  | 1.6  | -0.6 - 7.4  | 649 - 2025  | 18.1  |
| **Sunday** | 1.7  | -0.1 - 7.9  | 456 - 2092  | 17.6  |

| **Friday** | 3.9  | 0.5 - 8.1   | 736 - 1294  | 18.2  |

In the upcoming week, the electricity market will see fluctuating price developments. **On Saturday** and **Sunday**, low electricity prices are expected, with an average price below two cents. The low minimum pricing forecast for Saturday, -0.6 ¬¢, may be due to high wind power production, especially during the early morning hours. Sunday's maximum price of 7.9 ¬¢ might occur in the evening when wind power production is at its lowest.

**On Wednesday** and **Thursday**, the price forecast rises, particularly on Thursday, when the average price is at its highest, 4.4 ¬¢. Thursday's maximum price of 8.6 ¬¢ may occur in the evening when wind power production is weaker. The higher price levels on Wednesday and Thursday may be due to fluctuations in wind power production and its lower average level.

At the end of the week, **on Friday**, prices stabilize, but high maximum prices, up to 8.1 ¬¢, are still expected. This may be due to wind power production remaining at a lower level throughout the day.

Overall, the week's price expectations are generally below four cents for most of the time. Price fluctuations are partly due to variations in wind power production, particularly affecting individual hours.
