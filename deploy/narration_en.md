*In next week's electricity market forecasts, significant price fluctuations are expected, with a growing risk of price spikes especially towards the end of the week. Wind power production varies greatly, significantly impacting the electricity price trends.*

Currently, there are two ongoing maintenance outages at nuclear power plants. The Olkiluoto 3 plant, with a nominal capacity of 1600 MW, has been out of operation since 20.9.2025 at 01, with an estimated end time of 10.10.2025 at 01. Additionally, the Loviisa 1 plant, with a nominal capacity of 496 MW, has been undergoing maintenance since 6.9.2025 at 10, with an estimated end time of 29.9.2025 at 12. Due to these maintenance outages, the availability of training data is limited, which might affect the accuracy of the forecast.

The forecast was updated on Monday at 03:21.

Significant price fluctuations are expected in the electricity price forecasts for the week. **Tuesday** is predicted to be the cheapest day of the week, with an average price around 1.2 cents per kilowatt-hour, and even negative prices are possible at night. This is partly due to strong wind power production, averaging 4292 MW. Prices on **Wednesday** and **Thursday** are expected to rise slightly but remain at a reasonable level.

**Friday's** average price rises significantly, accompanied by a high risk of price spikes, especially during the afternoon and evening hours. This is partly due to low wind power production, averaging below 2500 MW. On **Saturday**, price spikes can become particularly high due to weak wind power, with the day's average price reaching 14.7 cents, making it the most expensive day of the week. Prices on **Sunday** and **Monday** are expected to remain high, but they are predicted to slightly decrease compared to Saturday.

Over the weekend and next Monday, the risk of price spikes is high, particularly during morning and evening hours. This is due to weak wind power production, which can cause unpredictable changes in pricing.
