Electricity price forecasts show clear variations in the coming days. The upcoming week will start with the highest prices on **Saturday**, when the average price will reach 8,2 cents. Prices within Saturday will experience exceptionally large fluctuations, as the lowest price will be only 0,3 cents, while at the highest, prices could rise even above 24 ¢. The risk of price spikes will be particularly high in the morning between 8–10 am.

On **Sunday**, however, price levels will sharply drop into negative territory. The average price forecast for Sunday is -0,9 cents, and the day's lowest price could even reach -1,8 cents. Sunday will thus be the cheapest day of the week for electricity users. The negative prices will result from exceptionally high wind power production, averaging over 3500 megawatts and peaking at above 5000 MW.

At the start of next week, electricity prices will remain moderate. **Monday's** average price is forecasted at 0,9 cents, with prices ranging from -0,9 to 3,7 cents. On **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, the price level will remain low, with average prices of 1,4 and 1,3 cents respectively. However, both days carry a slight risk of temporary price spikes. On Tuesday, a price peak could occur around 8 pm, when prices will approach four cents.

On **Thursday**, prices are expected to slightly increase but remain reasonable. The day's average price is forecasted at 2,3 cents, with the highest price reaching 4,7 cents. Thursday also carries a risk of individual price spikes, especially around 8 pm.

Thus, the week ahead will bring both strong fluctuations and exceptionally affordable moments in electricity pricing. Consumers should particularly notice Saturday's high peaks and Sunday's remarkably low prices.
