|:-------------|:----------------:|:----------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| **Tuesday** | 10,6 | 2,5 - 22,4 | 485 - 4634 | 1,2 |
| **Wednesday** | 1,5 | 0,9 - 2,2 | 4825 - 6524 | 1,4 |
| **Thursday** | 2,2 | 0,2 - 4,6 | 3436 - 6641 | 1,4 |
| **Friday** | 0,8 | -0,4 - 2,5 | 3238 - 5535 | 2,2 |
| **Saturday** | 2,3 | -0,3 - 4,4 | 3261 - 4998 | 1,1 |
| **Sunday** | 4,4 | 0,3 - 11,9 | 1306 - 4731 | 0,3 |
| **Monday** | 5,0 | 2,8 - 8,6 | 1505 - 4727 | -0,5 |

The week would look mostly moderate, but it would clearly stand out already on **Tuesday**. The day’s average price would climb to 10,6 ¢ and individual peak hours would rise clearly higher. A high spike risk is indicated, and the peak would fall around 8–10, with price reaching 22,4 ¢ and potentially materializing above the forecast. Wind power’s minimum would drop to just 485 MW on the same day, which would explain the higher maximum price.

The rest of the week would be notably more even. **Wednesday** would average 1,5 ¢, **Thursday** 2,2 ¢ and **Friday** 0,8 ¢. Negative minimum prices (−0,4 ¢ and −0,3 ¢) are anticipated for the nights of Friday and **Saturday**; the cheapest hours would occur on Friday at 2–4. **Sunday** would edge higher (avg 4,4 ¢, max 11,9 ¢). Next **Monday** would stay moderate (avg 5,0 ¢, max 8,6 ¢). On most days, abundant wind power would explain the low prices, while Tuesday’s weak wind output would explain the spike.
