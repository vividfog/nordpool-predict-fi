The coming week shows variable electricity prices. **Tuesday** stands out with the highest average price of 6.1 cents. Tuesday's maximum price reaches 12.3 cents, the highest of the week. Meanwhile, Tuesday's wind power production varies greatly, which can partly explain this price gap.

**Wednesday** and **Thursday** appear as moderate days, but Wednesday's maximum price rises to 14.2 cents, so price fluctuations may occur. The high maximum price on Wednesday is related to low nighttime wind power production, which raises prices.

**Sunday** offers the lowest average prices of the week, averaging only 1.0 cents. Wind power is abundantly available on Sunday, explaining the moderate prices.

The cheapest hours of the week are expected on Sunday morning, when prices might even drop to negative. Weekend days are otherwise affordable, except for a slight rise in Saturday evening prices.

Overall, the week offers electricity users relatively affordable prices, but days like Tuesday show that price fluctuations are possible.
