The week’s price picture will be favorable from Wednesday to Friday: daily averages will stay clearly below four cents, and Friday’s is expected at 0,8 ¢. A clear outlier will be **Tuesday**, when the average will be lifted to 10,0 ¢ and the day’s peak will reach 21,2 ¢. Wind output will drop to a minimum of 652 megawatts then, which explains the higher maximum price. In addition, a risk of isolated price spikes is flagged for Tuesday, potentially falling between 08–10. From **Wednesday** onward, strong winds will push prices down throughout the day.

Later in the week the low level will continue: **Friday** will even feature negative prices briefly at night, roughly between 02–04. On **Saturday** the average will hold around 2,2 ¢. A clear rise is projected for **Sunday** evening, with prices climbing around 18–20 toward the ten‑cent mark (daily maximum 10,8 ¢). Next **Monday** the average will rise to 6,1 ¢ and intraday variation will be modest, with the peak staying below 10 ¢.
