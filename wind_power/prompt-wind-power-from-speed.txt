### Your task

The goal of this project is to develop machine learning models that can predict future wind power using historical data. This dataset includes information on electricity prices, wind power, wind speed, and outdoor temperature, focusing particularly on weather conditions in Finland. The models will provide hourly wind power predictions and assess the impact of both typical and extreme weather scenarios on electricity prices.

You can download the dataset from here: https://filebin.net/kz1gr81v727hizdo/hourly_wind_power_price_temp_speed.csv

Here's a preview of how the dataset begins:

The project's aim is to predict wind power for any given hour based on wind speed. Optimally this would be expressed as a function. A native function would be "wind power in MWh = 1000 * wind speed in m/s" but that would obviously be false. What we want is a more elaborate formula, or a model that can calculate the speed, or a proper multiplier to use. 

Wind power is in MWh
Wind speed is in m/s
Ignore other data in the file

### Approach:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The first step involves cleaning the dataset and engineering features that could impact the result.

2. **Model Selection and Training**:
   - **Random Forests is selected for its ability to handle nonlinear relationships and their robustness in various scenarios without the need for the data to be in sequence format.
   - The model will be trained on the dataset, and their performance will be validated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared values. This ensures that the model can generalize well to unseen data.

3. **Model Training and Validation**:
   - The dataset will be split into training and testing sets.
   - The model will be trained.
   - Model performance will be evaluated on the test set to ensure accuracy and reliability.

4. **Prediction and Evaluation**:
   - The trained model will be used to predict wind power for specified conditions.
   - Predictions will be evaluated against actual power for 500 randomly selected samples from the original dataset.
   - The output will include both the predicted and reference power, providing a clear comparison of the model's performance.

### Expected Outcomes:

- Concrete performance metrics for Random Forests will be reported, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared values. This data will offer insight into each model's accuracy and effectiveness in predicting electricity prices under various conditions.

- An expert evaluation of the quality of the model, based on the metrics.

- A Python command line utility, which can be used to generate a power estimate, if given date, time, temperature and wind speed.

- A sample run of the said utility, given a sample date, time, temperature and wind speed. We will use Feb 11, 01:00 AM, -21 Â°C, 1 m/s for this sample run as input.

This approach aims to to develop a reliable predictive tool for wind power forecasting in Finland, based on real-world weather conditions and historical data.
