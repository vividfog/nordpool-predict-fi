### Your task

The goal of this project is to develop machine learning models that can predict future electricity prices using historical data. This dataset includes information on electricity prices, wind speed, and outdoor temperature, focusing particularly on weather conditions in Finland. The models will provide hourly price predictions and assess the impact of both typical and extreme weather scenarios on electricity prices.

You can download the dataset from here: https://filebin.net/an4ah85smc5rqjl7/a04e9cd96b9557edf877b5e54fab529472e1928db7cd869833516cf92248aabe.csv

Here's a preview of how the dataset begins:

"Date Time","Temp [°C]","Wind [m/s]","Price [c/kWh]"
"2023-02-28 22:00:00","0.2","3.8","2.507"
"2023-02-28 23:00:00","-0.1","3.7","2.691"
"2023-03-01 00:00:00","-1.1","3.1","2.547"
"2023-03-01 01:00:00","-1.4","3.3","2.554"
"2023-03-01 02:00:00","-1.6","3.5","2.601"
"2023-03-01 03:00:00","-2","3","2.804"


Negative temperatures and electricity prices indicate scenarios where demand is lower than supply. The project's aim is to predict electricity prices for any given hour based on temperature, wind speed, and specific date and time inputs.

### Approach:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The first step involves cleaning the dataset and engineering features that could impact electricity prices, such as time of day, day of the week, and seasonality indicators extracted from the "Date Time" column.

2. **Model Selection and Training**:
   - **Random Forests is selected for its ability to handle nonlinear relationships and their robustness in various scenarios without the need for the data to be in sequence format.
   - The model will be trained on the dataset, and their performance will be validated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared values. This ensures that the model can generalize well to unseen data.

3. **Model Training and Validation**:
   - The dataset will be split into training and testing sets.
   - The model will be trained.
   - Model performance will be evaluated on the test set to ensure accuracy and reliability.

4. **Prediction and Evaluation**:
   - The trained model will be used to predict electricity prices for specified conditions.
   - Predictions will be evaluated against actual prices for 100 randomly selected samples from the original dataset.
   - The output will include both the predicted and reference prices, providing a clear comparison of the model's performance.

### Expected Outcomes:

- Concrete performance metrics for Random Forests will be reported, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared values. This data will offer insight into each model's accuracy and effectiveness in predicting electricity prices under various conditions.

- An expert evaluation of the quality of the model, based on the metrics.

- A Python command line utility, which can be used to generate a price estimate, if given date, time, temperature and wind speed.

- A sample run of the said utility, given a sample date, time, temperature and wind speed. We will use Feb 11, 01:00 AM, -21 °C, 1 m/s for this sample run as input.

This approach aims to to develop a reliable predictive tool for electricity price forecasting in Finland, based on real-world weather conditions and historical price data.
