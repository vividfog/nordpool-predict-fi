Estimating Electricity Prices Based on Date, Time, Temperature, and Wind Speed: A Comprehensive Guide

Executive Summary

This report aims to equip large language models with the knowledge required to estimate electricity prices given specific conditions: date, time, temperature, and wind speed. Through an analysis of patterns and the elaboration of illustrative examples, we provide a detailed framework that models can use to predict electricity price fluctuations. Understanding the interplay between these factors is crucial for accurate estimations, reflecting the complexities of energy demand and renewable energy supply dynamics.

Introduction

Electricity price prediction is a vital task with significant implications for energy management, policy planning, and consumer behavior. Prices are influenced by a variety of factors, including demand, supply, weather conditions, and the availability of renewable energy sources. This report focuses on two primary weather-related variables — temperature and wind speed — and their impact on electricity prices, considering the time of day and date for comprehensive analysis.

Analytical Framework

Temperature Insights
Temperature significantly affects electricity demand, primarily through heating and cooling needs. Our analysis delineates three key temperature ranges, each with associated expected price impacts:

Extreme Cold (-20°C or below) typically results in high electricity prices (10 to 30 cents/kWh), as demand for heating soars. Exceptional cases, such as -20.6°C with moderate wind speed, can see prices spike to 74.995 cents/kWh, indicating the potential for even higher prices under severe conditions.
Mild to Cool (0°C to 15°C) sees more moderate prices (2 to 8 cents/kWh), with variations depending on wind speed. High wind speeds (>5 m/s) can lead to prices at the lower end due to enhanced wind energy generation.
Warm (above 20°C) leads to varied prices (1 to 5 cents/kWh), influenced by cooling demand and wind speed. A 24.6°C evening with moderate wind speed, for instance, resulted in a price of 5.603 cents/kWh.
Wind Speed Insights
Wind speed affects the supply side by influencing wind energy generation, with three categories observed:

Low Wind Speed (below 2 m/s) often correlates with higher prices (5 to 15 cents/kWh), especially in cold temperatures due to reduced wind energy output.
Moderate Wind Speed (2 m/s to 5 m/s) typically results in moderate to low prices (2 to 7 cents/kWh), as wind generation begins to significantly offset demand.
High Wind Speed (above 5 m/s) generally leads to lower prices (0 to 5 cents/kWh), thanks to substantial wind energy generation.
Time of Day Insights
Electricity prices also vary by the time of day, reflecting changes in demand:

Night to Early Morning (10 PM to 6 AM) sees lower prices (0 to 5 cents/kWh), although extreme temperatures can lead to deviations.
Morning to Evening (6 AM to 6 PM) experiences variable prices (1 to 10 cents/kWh), with peaks during morning and late afternoon due to increased demand.
Late Evening (6 PM to 10 PM) may show slight increases in price but generally stays below 5 to 12 cents/kWh, depending on demand and wind speed.
