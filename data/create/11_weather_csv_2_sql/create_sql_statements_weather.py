"""
This script processes weather data from multiple CSV files and generates SQL statements to populate a database table,
specifically for a `prediction` table that stores hourly weather data predictions.

The script performs the following steps:
1. **Determine the Full Timestamp Range**: It scans through all available CSV files to find the minimum and maximum timestamps, 
   thus determining the complete range of timestamps for which data should exist in the database.

2. **Generate INSERT Statements**: For every hour within the determined timestamp range, an INSERT SQL statement is created to ensure 
   the presence of a corresponding entry in the `prediction` table for each timestamp.

3. **Process Each CSV File**: For every CSV file:
   - The script infers the weather station ID from the file name.
   - It reads the file into a DataFrame, ensuring the 'Timestamp' column is parsed as a datetime object and used as an index.
   - Data is resampled to hourly intervals, with any missing data being interpolated.
   
4. **Generate UPDATE Statements**: For each timestamp and the associated value in the resampled DataFrame, an UPDATE SQL statement is 
   created to insert the interpolated data into the appropriate fields in the `prediction` table.

Usage:
- CSV files must be located in the same directory, or the path in the `glob.glob` function should be adjusted accordingly.
- Each CSV file must have a 'Timestamp' column for indexing, and fixed columns 'TA_PT1H_AVG' and 'WS_PT1H_AVG'.

Dependencies: 
- `pandas` for data manipulation, `numpy` for numerical operations, and `glob` for file operations.
- Assumes the presence of a SQLite `prediction` table with columns corresponding to station-specific weather data.

Note:
- Before executing, it is essential to ensure that the database schema corresponds to the expected column names.
- The interpolation method used is linear; adjust as needed for different data requirements.
